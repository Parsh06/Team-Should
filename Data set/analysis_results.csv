ED questions Tejashwi Yadav for over eight hours in land-for-jobs scam case,"The Enforcement Directorate questioned RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for more than eight hours on Tuesday in connection with a money laundering case. The development came a day after the agency quizzed his father Lalu Prasad Yadav about an alleged land-for-jobs scam. Opposition leaders meanwhile asserted that the BJP‚Äôs top leadership was ‚Äòafraid‚Äô and targeting them by ‚Äòmisusing‚Äô the central probe agencies. 







    The agency had filed a prosecution complaint against several members of the Yadav family at the beginning of January in connection with the scam. It alleges that the former Chief Minister's kin ‚Äî Rabri Devi, Misha Bharti and Hema Yadav ‚Äî received land parcels for nominal amounts as a bribe. 




   The ED probe was initiated on the basis of a CBI FIR that accuses former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav of indulging in corrupt practices. The case pertains to the appointment of Group D substitutes in Indian Railways between 2004 and 2009.¬†        The CBI filed its chargesheet in October last year against former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi, their daughter Misa Bharti, and 13 others. The central agency asserts that the candidates were asked to transfer land as a bribe in return for the jobs.




   Tejashwi Yadav arrived at the ED office in Patna amid heavy security deployment on Tuesday morning as a large number of RJD supporters raised slogans. The former deputy chief minister was quizzed for more than eight hours ‚Äî leaving the premises after 8 pm. Reports quoting sources indicate that his statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. However details about the interaction remain elusive at present.    He appeared before the probe agency a day after his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was questioned for nearly ten hours by the central agency in the same case.    (With inputs from agencies)

AAP candidate Kuldeep Kumar breaks down in tears after losing Chandigarh Mayor's post | Watch video,"Amid the allegations of the INDIA bloc against the BJP of voting discrepancies during the Chandigarh Mayoral elections, AAP candidate Kuldeep Kumar broke down in front of the media after losing Chandigarh Mayor's post by 2 votes from BJP candidate Manoj Sonkar. 

















   The BJP mayoral candidate Manoj Sonkar won 16 votes during the election, whereas, Kuldeep Singh, a joint candidate of Congress and AAP managed to secure only 12 votes. Whereas, eight votes were declared invalid.        After the announcement of the result, the AAP and the Congress attacked the BJP and alleged the saffron party of ""shameless capture"" of the democratic system in the country.    The BJP swept the Chandigarh mayoral polls retaining the three top posts in a setback to the AAP and the Congress which had contested the elections as allies.    After the announcement of the result, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal called the polls a ‚ÄúBlack day for democracy"". Later in the day, the AAP and Congress filed a joint petition in the Punjab-Haryana High Court expressing concerns about the integrity of the recently conducted mayoral elections in Chandigarh.    The matter will be taken up by the HC on Wednesday. The hearing will take place tomorrow morning after both the parties file a petition regarding the mayoral elections, said Ferry Sofat, the lawyer representing the AAP and Congress in the Punjab Haryana High Court.    ""What BJP did today to finish democracy - the whole country watched it. They tried to hijack the election. We have challenged the entire process in this writ petition. We have also submitted proper evidence‚Ä¶,"" said Sofat mentioning that the HC, in its previous hearing, had stated that the Mayor polls should be conducted freely and fairly with the entire voting process being videographed.    After the rejection of multiple votes during vote counting, ¬†AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged ""robbery"" by the BJP, describing their victory as a ""blatant theft.""    BJP's Manoj Sonkar's victory in the Chandigarh mayoral elections marked the first direct electoral contest between the BJP and the Opposition INDIA bloc. The elections were rescheduled on the directions of the Punjab-Haryana High Court.    Rejecting the INDIA bloc's allegations of discrepancies, newly-elected Chandigarh Mayor Manoj Sonkar said, ‚ÄúWherever they don't have their way, they level allegations...Everything is on camera. But when they couldn't digest their defeat, they created this atmosphere and started blaming us.""

Lok Sabha polls 2024: Samajwadi Party names 16 candidates; Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav to fight from Mainpuri,"The Samajwadi Party on Tuesday sounded the bugle of Lok Sabha elections 2024 as they released the list of candidates for 16 seats in Uttar Pradesh. The list includes the name of Dimple Yadav, the wife of SP's chief Akhilesh Yadav, who will contest the general elections from her current seat of Mainpuri. 







    The other candidates on the list include Shafiqur Rahman Barq from Sambhal, Ravidas Mehrotra from Lucknow, Akshay Yadav from Firozabad, Devesh Shakya from Etah, Dharmendra Yadav from Budaun, Utkarsh Verma from Kheri, Anand Bhadauria from Dhaurahra, Anu Tandon from Unnao, Naval Kishore from Farrukhabad, Rajaram Pal from Akbarpur, Shivshankar Singh Patel from Banda, Awadhesh Prasad from Faizabad, Lalji Verma from Ambedkar Nagar, Ramprasad Chaudhary from Basti, and Kajal Nishad from Gorakhpur. 




   The development is significant since Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party is part of the Opposition INDIA bloc and has been negotiating the seat-sharing arrangements with the Congress.        Uttar Pradesh is the most crucial state for the Lok Sabha elections and the good performance of the BJP in this state is one of the major reasons for their dominance at the national level. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 62 seats out of the total 80 while a pre-poll alliance between SP, BSP, and RLD managed to get just 15 seats.  Congress won just 1 seat in that election during which it lost some of its major bastions in Uttar Pradesh.  SP-Congress seat-sharing talksRecently, Akhilesh Yadav has signaled some breakthrough in the seat-sharing talks with Congress as he said that the Samajwadi Party is ready to give 11 seats to Congress. The grand-old party has been demanding 20 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which looks like a long-shot considering their performances in the general and assembly elections in the state.    The Mayawati's BSP has cleared that they will go solo in the Uttar Pradesh elections and that is going to work as a crucial advantage for the BJP.    ¬†

Chandigarh mayoral polls: Rahul Gandhi invokes Godse on ‚Äòcheating‚Äô claims; Kejriwal 'worried' for Lok Sabha | 10 points,"The Chandigarh mayoral polls witnessed high-voltage drama on Tuesday after the BJP defeated Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress, who were contesting the polls as part of the INDIA bloc. The AAP claimed that the presiding officer wrongly declared eight votes of Congress and AAP councilors invalid while Rahul Gandhi went a step further and invoked Nathuram Godse's assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.¬† 







    Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called it ‚Äúcheating in broad daylight,"" and a black day for the democracy of India. The national convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that if the BJP can ‚Äústoop so low"" to win a mayoral election then it can go to any extent to win the Lok Sabha elections. 




   ""This time under INDIA Alliance, Congress and AAP came together... Their (BJP) intention had been maligned since the beginning... They tried to buy ours and Congress' councillors. They tried to scare them like they do all over the country... But fortunately, not even one councillor broke down..."" the Delhi Chief Minister said.¬†        ‚ÄúIt is beyond imagination what the BJP, which can kill democracy in front of the whole world in the Mayor elections, will do to remain in power in Delhi. Years ago, on this day, Godse had assassinated Gandhiji and today Godseists sacrificed his ideals and constitutional values,"" Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said.¬†  Chandigarh mayoral polls: AAP accuses BJP of ‚Äòcheating‚Äô; 10 points1. The Chandigarh mayoral polls were conducted on Tuesday after the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which rapped the administration for delaying the elections earlier scheduled for 18 January.    2. In the 35-member corporation, the combined voting strength of the AAP and the Congress was 20, whereas the BJP held 15 votes, comprising 14 from councilors and one from MP Kirron Kher.    3. The voting started around 11:00 PM at the Assembly Hall of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation    4. After the counting, the presiding officer declared BJP's Manoj Sonkar as the winner with 16 votes and 8 votes of AAP and Congress councilors were not counted.¬†    5. The AAP launched a scathing attack on the BJP after the defeat and called it ‚Äòcheating in broad daylight.‚Äô ""The manner in which cheating has been done in broad daylight in the Chandigarh Mayor elections is extremely worrying. If these people can stoop so low in a mayor's election, then they can go to any extent in the country's elections. This is very worrying,"" Arvind Kejriwal wrote on X in Hindi.    6. The other senior AAP leaders also reacted to the developments in Chandigarh and said that the way elections were conducted was a setback for the Indian democracy.    7. ""This is not a setback for one coalition, one alliance or one party. It is a setback for India's democracy...We are aggrieved and hurt & we are worried as to what will happen in the upcoming 2024 polls. If the BJP can resort to such low levels & commit forgery & illegality...BJP can go to any level to rig the election process..."" AAP's Rajya Sabha member Raghav Chadha said.    8. ""This is robbery. In Chandigarh, there are 36 Councillor seats out of which 14 seats are BJPs & 13 seats are AAPs, and 7 seats of Congress. Total AAP (13 + 7) has 20 seats...BJP has been exposed again..."" Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said.    9. BJP chief JP Nadda congratulated his party for winning the Mayor elections and said that UTs are witnessing record development under the leadership of PM Modi.    10. ""Congratulations to BJP Chandigarh Unit for winning the Mayor election. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UTs have witnessed record development. That the INDI Alliance fought their first electoral battle and still lost to BJP shows that neither their arithmetic is working nor their chemistry,"" BJP chief JP Nadda said on X.    ¬†

"'A little pressure is exerted, he takes U-turn': Rahul Gandhi mocks Bihar CM, says 'we don't need Nitish Kumar...'","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday criticised Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and reiterated that 'Mahagathbandhan' will continue fighting for social justice in the state and the alliance does not need CM Nitish Kumar for the cause.

   ""The time has come for an X-ray of India to ascertain the population in this country. The first step towards social justice is an X-ray of the country,"" he added.

Is Congress' flawed strategy responsible for breakups in INDIA bloc as Lok Sabha polls near?,"The opposition INDIA bloc is in the grip of a political crisis as a key alliance partner, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, ditched the ‚ÄòMahagathbandhan‚Äô and returned to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) fold ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. 







    Apart from private meetings succeeded by press briefings, the INDIA bloc, formed seven months ago in Patna, has not conducted any significant public outreach programmes. With time ticking away, there is a lack of clarity on when the bloc will finalise the allocation of seats among its member parties. 




   Nitish Kumar played a pivotal role in the INDIA bloc, a coalition of 28 opposition parties. His exit shortly before the Lok Sabha elections in 2024 is anticipated to have repercussions on the alliance. Nitish Kumar, while announcing his resignation and the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly on Sunday, cited that the situation arose because ‚Äúnot everything was alright.""    




   JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi attributed the breakdown of the INDIA bloc in Bihar to the Congress, stating that Congress leaders prioritised strengthening their party over the opposition grouping, as conveyed to ANI. Tyagi had even accused a section of the Congress leadership of repeatedly ""insulting"" Nitish Kumar.    However, after Kumar's exit, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut claimed, ‚ÄúThe Congress was in favour of appointing Nitish as the convenor of the INDIA bloc.""  All is 'not' well with the rest of the parties?Trinamool Congress (TMC)Nitish Kumar's exit marks the second setback for the INDIA alliance, coming in the wake of recent developments in West Bengal, including the announcement by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee chose to break ties with the Congress and opt for an independent path in the upcoming Lok Sabha election in the state, just a day before Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was set to begin in the state.    Also Read: Mamata Banerjee blames Congress for seat-sharing delay over ‚Äòunjust‚Äô demands, Rahul says ‚ÄòBengal CM close to‚Ä¶‚Äô    The rift between the TMC and the Congress escalated as state unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury persistently criticised the Bengal chief minister. During a press conference on Tuesday, Adhir Chowdhury asserted that Mamata Banerjee attained power in the 2011 elections thanks to the support of the Congress party.  Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)The JD(U) chief's resignation occurred shortly after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab dismissed speculations about a seat-sharing agreement with the Congress in the state for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.    Also Read: No AAP alliance with Congress in Punjab for 2024 Lok Sabha polls: CM Bhagwant Mann    AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal stated on Sunday that his party would independently contest all 90 assembly seats in Haryana. However, he mentioned that the Lok Sabha elections would be contested as part of the INDIA bloc. Kejriwal's declaration follows the recent decision by AAP, a member of the INDIA bloc, to rule out any alliance with the Congress in Punjab for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha polls.  Samajwadi Party (SP)The Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) expressed dissatisfaction with the allocation of 18 seats offered by the Samajwadi Party (SP) to the two INDIA bloc allies in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing arrangement for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The SP proposed 11 seats for the Congress and seven seats for the RLD in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.    The Congress is insisting on receiving at least the 22 seats it secured in 2009, while the RLD is seeking eight seats in the politically significant state, which comprises a total of 80 Lok Sabha constituencies.    Discontent with the seats allocated by the SP, a senior leader told PTI that the RLD conveyed that the party is seeking an additional seat. However, Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X that the party's cordial alliance with the Congress is off to a ‚Äúgood start"".

Sonia Gandhi is the sole Congress Member of Parliament from the state, representing the Rae Bareli constituency. The Apna Dal (Sonelal) has secured two Lok Sabha seats, while the BJP has 64 seats in the state.    Opposition leaders have expressed doubts regarding the Congress party's choice to opt out of the alliance collaboration in the state elections. Omar Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and a prominent leader of a regional party in the state, remarked that the Congress only ‚Äúremembered the I.N.D.I.A. alliance after three months.""    Earlier on July 18, led by Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress party, 26 opposition parties rebranded themselves as INDIA, standing for the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, replacing their previous name UPA or United Progressive Alliance.    The outcome of the parliamentary coalition against the BJP, the current ruling party, in the 2024 general elections remains uncertain.

Hemant Soren faces ED probe: Jharkhand CM arrives in Ranchi amid ‚Äòmissing‚Äô allegations from BJP,"Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren arrived at his residence in Ranchi on Tuesday amid intense political activity around the leader. The officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), who were supposed to question him in the money laundering case claimed that they failed to locate the JMM leader. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared that the chief minister is ""missing"" and is ‚Äúon the run"" from a federal agency. 







    After reaching his residence in Ranchi, Hemant Soren said he was ready to depose before the ED on Wednesday at 1:00 p.m.¬† 




   The ED reached his Delhi residence on Monday to question the leader, but couldn't find him there. The probe agency then seized his BMW car and  ‚Çπ36 lakh in cash and claimed that they had found ""incriminating"" documents after it searched the Delhi house of the Jharkhand chief minister.¬†        The Opposition BJP alleged that the chief minister is ‚Äúon the run"" from the ED probe and even announced  ‚Çπ11,000 on credible information leading to his arrest. Governor CP Radhakrishnan had mentioned that he is closely monitoring the situation. ""It is the job of the Governor, I am doing it. We will cross the bridge when it comes,"" he said.    In the interim, instructions have been given for all Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) belonging to the ruling coalition, which includes the JMM, the Congress, and the RJD, to remain in Ranchi, giving rise to conjecture about the subsequent developments.

"Land-for-jobs scam: PMLA court summons former Bihar CM Rabri Devi, daughter Misa Bharti","A PMLA court has issued a summon for Amit Katyal, former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, Misha Bharti, Hema Yadav, and Hridyanand Chaudhary, instructing their presence on February 9, 2024, to proceed with the trial related to the purported ‚Äòland for job scam‚Äô, Enforcement Directorate (ED) stated in an official release. 







    Earlier on January 1, 2024, the ED lodged a prosecution complaint (PC) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, against Amit Katyal, Rabri Devi, Misha Bharti, Hema Yadav, Hridyanand Chaudhary, and two companies - A K Infosystems Private Limited and A B Exports Pvt. Ltd.

   Amit Katyal, a businessman allegedly linked to former Bihar chief minister and RJD patriarch Lalu Yadav's family members, is reportedly under scrutiny. The investigations were initiated by the central agency following an FIR filed by the CBI regarding the ‚Äòland for job scam.‚Äô    The allegations suggest that Lalu Yadav, who was the Railway Minister at the time, engaged in corrupt practices concerning the appointment of Group D substitutes in Indian Railways between 2004 and 2009.

BJP-JD(S) clash with Congress in Karnataka as row over removal of Hanuman flag intensifies,"The removal of a saffron flag bearing Lord Hanuman's image has triggered an extensive political row in Karnataka. The BJP and JD(S) staged protests against the ruling party on Monday with several politicians accusing the Siddaramaiah-led government of failing to handle the situation. The Congress meanwhile insists that the flag was removed as permission was only sought to hoist the national Tricolour and the Karnataka State flag. 







    Former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy accused the government of playing politics on the issue, and instigating the people by using police force to quell the public unrest. He also took to Twitter on Monday evening to share photos from a two-party protest in Mandya over the removal of ‚ÄòHanuman dwaja‚Äô in Keragodu village. 




   ‚ÄúYou claim to have administrative experience, having presented 14 budgets (in the state assembly). If you have even a bit of administrative knowledge, set right your government's mistakes first,"" he urged the CM.        ‚ÄúInstead of accusing (opposition parties) of doing politics, set things right. It is not us (opposition) who are doing things keeping the Lok Sabha polls in mind‚Ä¶If they don't set things right, they will not be able to walk on the streets,"" he added.

Foreign secretary Kwatra visits Bhutan as new government takes office,"New Delhi: Foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra began a three-day visit to Bhutan on Monday, a day after newly-elected Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay assumed office. The visit holds significance as the new government prepares to tackle the complex task of negotiating a border settlement with China.¬† 







    During his visit, Kwatra is scheduled to meet with King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk and Prime Minister Tsobgay, along with other high-ranking Bhutanese officials, including the foreign minister. 




   In 2021, Bhutan and China agreed to a three-step roadmap to address their unresolved border dispute. This roadmap involves delineating the border on maps, followed by surveys and formal demarcation, according to some observers. Progress in these border talks has been relatively swift, with the establishment of technical teams and the 25th round of border talks held in August and October 2023, respectively.        The resolution of the border issue is expected to pave the way for formal diplomatic relations between Bhutan and China. Bhutan, which has faced economic challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic and labour outflows, stands to benefit from potential Chinese investments.    On the other hand, India closely monitors these border negotiations, particularly in the context of the Doklam tri-junction, where past standoffs have occurred. Bhutan has been a longstanding diplomatic ally of India and has faced increasing pressure from China to settle the boundary dispute.    Both Bhutan and India maintain open communication regarding the progress of talks between Thimpu and Beijing. Bhutan's King made two visits to India in 2023, holding multiple high-level meetings. India has reaffirmed its support for Bhutan's five-year plans and the hydropower sector, emphasizing the strong bilateral ties between the two nations.

"'This is wrong': Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Nitish Kumar's political somersault, says ‚Äò‚Ä¶not good for democracy‚Äô","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday disparaged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for his political flip-flop to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after dumping the INDIA bloc. 







    The Aam Aadmi Party chief said Nitish Kumar didn't do the right thing by exiting the INDIA bloc. He also said that the JDU chief's conduct is not good for democracy. 




   ""I feel this is wrong and he should not have left. Such conduct is not good for democracy,"" Kejriwal said at a press conference responding to a question on Nitish Kumar forming a new government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar.        On Sunday, Nitish Kumar took oath as the Bihar chief minister for the ninth time. The development has come after he broke ties with the INDIA bloc and ‚ÄòMahagathbandhan‚Äô and joined the NDA to form a government with the BJP.¬†    After dumping the INDIA bloc, Nitish Kumar said, ""Things were not working well"" for him in the 'Mahagathbandhan' or the grand alliance. He returned to the BJP-led NDA and formed a new government, which he had dumped less than 18 months ago.    Now dismantled, Mahagathbandhan consisted of political parties including JD (U), RJD, Congress, and Left parties. The AAP is part of the INDIA bloc and is in seat-sharing talks with the Congress for five states -- Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat, Goa, and Haryana.    On Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal announced that his party will contest alone in all 90 seats in the Haryana assembly elections. He also clarified that he will contest together with the INDIA alliance in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.    ""For the upcoming Lok Sabha elections we will contest elections together with the INDIA alliance but for the assembly elections, we will contest alone on all 90 seats of Haryana by itself,"" Kejriwal said.    ""Today, the AAP is the largest group in Haryana compared to other political parties like the Congress, the BJP, and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP). There is a committee of 15-20 people in every village and ward. There are nearly 1.25 lakh office-bearers of the party in Haryana. This has been achieved in the last six months,"" Kejriwal added.

"BJP using CBI, ED to threaten people to get votes in Lok Sabha polls, says Mamata Banerjee","West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of threatening people to send probe agencies to their homes if they do not vote for the saffron party in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. 







    Mamata Banerjee also asserted that she will not follow any diktat of the BJP to worship any particular god. 




   ‚ÄúI follow Ramayana, Quran, Bible and Guru Granth Sahib... I do not do drama by visiting poor people's homes to eat food brought from outside,"" the West Bengal chief minister said during a public distribution programme in Cooch Behar.        She advised locals in Cooch Behar, particularly Rajbanshis, to ensure that their names are on the voters‚Äô list to ‚Äúprotect themselves"" from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.    ‚ÄúThe BJP is using central agencies for elections... it is threatening people over the phone to send Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths to their homes if they do not vote for the saffron party,"" Mamata Banerjee said.    She also alleged that the Centre is bringing up the issue of CAA to do politics before the Lok Sabha polls.¬†    ‚ÄúWe have fought against the NRC. Rajbanshis are citizens of India. They have again started shouting CAA, CAA for the sake of votes,"" the CM said.    Her¬†remarks came after Union minister Shantanu Thakur said on Sunday that the CAA will be implemented across the country in a week.¬†    The West Bengal CM said that her government has acknowledged all colonies as ‚Äúpermanent addresses"",¬† and all residents who get the benefit of various state government benefits are citizens of the country. ‚ÄúAll of you are citizens. We have given permanent addresses to all colonies. They get ration, go to school, get scholarships, get Kisan Bandhu, Shikhashree, Oikoshree, Laxmir Bhandar. How could they get these benefits if they had not been citizens? Had they been able to cast votes if they were not citizens?"" she asked.

"Uttarakhand govt to get UCC Committee's report on Feb 2, Assembly session on 5 Feb: What to expect?","Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said on Monday that the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Committee's report will be delivered to the state government on February 2. The statement came after a Uttarakhand minister suggested that there could be a debate on the draft of the UCC during the state assembly session ‚Äî set to be held from February 5 to February 8. 







    In his latest statement on Monday, Dhami told ANI, ""While making a promise to the people of the state in the 2022 assembly elections, we constituted the UCC Committee, taking a pledge to implement the Uniform Civil Code in the state. The committee has completed its work and on February 2, it will submit its report to us."" 




 What will happen next?The Uttarakhand Chief Minister further said that after receiving the report on February 2, it will be brought to the Uttarakhand Cabinet. After that, action will be taken in the state assembly to enact the Uniform Civil Code Act.      What is expected from the UCC Act?The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) proposes a common set of laws dealing with a range a issues, including marriage, inheritance, adoption and gender equality for every citizen in India. Article 44 of the Constitution of India says that the state shall endeavour to secure a UCC throughout the territory of India.  On the same lines, Uttarakhand's UCC Act may include:  1. Provisions that treat men and women equally in issues relating to inheritance.  2. The UCC may reject the practices of polygamy, iddat, and halal.  3. The minimum age for marriage for both men and women may remain the same as it was previously (18 years for women and 21 years for men), the Indian Express reported.    However, News 18 reported last year that the age limit of girls for marriage might be increased in the UCC structure. It added that Graduation is likely to be made mandatory before marriage so that the age limit will be increased automatically - from 18 years to 21 years.  4. Marriage registration might be made necessary. People might not avail the benefit of government schemes without registration of marriage.  ALSO READ: Income tax: How Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India will impact HUF (Hindu Undivided Families) tax outgo  5. The UCC may also regulate live-in relationships and require a mandatory declaration to start and terminate live-in relationships. The provisions might also include that parents must be informed for the live-in relationship.  6. Provisions might be included to provide both husband and wife equal grounds for divorce. The basis of divorce will be applied to both the husband and wife, not one party will have an upper hand, News 18 had reported.  7. The guardianship process might become easier if the child is an orphan  8. The number of children to a couple can be fixed. Everyone might be granted the right to adopt - irrespective of religion, gender etc  What PM Modi says on UCCPrime Minister Narendra Modi said the country cannot run on two laws and that the Uniform Civil Code was in keeping with the founding principles and ideals of the Constitution.    ""Today, people are being instigated in the name of the UCC. How can the country run on two (laws)? The Constitution also talks of equal rights...Supreme Court has also asked to implement the UCC. These (opposition) people are playing vote bank politics,"" PM Modi was quoted by ANI as saying.  What critics say about UCCCongress leader Harish Rawat had said, ""If different states have different UCCs, the very purpose of having a common law for all sections of society across the country will be defeated.""

Bihar politics: Prashant Kishor calls Nitish Kumar 'sardar of palturams'; predicts JD(U)'s fate in 2025 elections,"Political strategist and former JD(U) leader Prashant Kishor on Sunday said that not just Nitish Kumar, but all politicians in Bihar are ‚Äòpalturams.‚Äô Prashant Kishor asserted that in the past year, he was the only leader to openly claim that Nitish Kumar would change sides anytime and the Bihar Chief Minister is a ""sardar of palturams."" The Jan Suraaj Abhiyan leader also predicted the fate of Nitish Kumar's JD(U) in the Bihar assembly elections 2025. 







  Bihar politics LIVE: Nitish Kumar to take oath as Bihar CM for record 9th time""If you look back at my remarks over the past year, then you would find out that I was the only person who on camera said that Nitish Kumar can change his side anytime. People already know that Nitish Kumar is a 'palturam' and 'sardar of palturams'. However, today's incident has shown that all politicians in Bihar are also 'palturam',"" Prashant Kishor said as per PTI. 




 Prashant Kishor said that the political equations in Bihar will undergo a substantial change ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 and the developments will be more dramatic.        ""In the present Bihar picture, there are two sides. On one hand, Nitish Kumar is the face, supported by the BJP. On the other, there is RJD and the other parties. The Bihar assembly election will not take place in this formation. Before the next Bihar election, there will be many dramatic developments in Bihar. Within six months after the Lok Sabha election, you will see those developments,"" Prashant Kishor said.  'Will take retirement if JD(U) gets more than 20 seats'The political strategist, who is a well-known force behind many successful politicians in India said that Nitish Kumar left Mahgathbandhan as he got scared of his prediction. Prashant Kishor said that in case JD(U) gets more than 20 seats in the 2025 Bihar assembly elections, he will take retirement.    ""They got scared after my prediction and already left Mahgathbandhan. My next prediction is Nitish Kumar's party won't get more than 20 seats in the state election. Please write it down. If JD(U) gets more than 20 seats in the state, I will take retirement,"" Prashant Kishor said.    ¬†

Nitish Kumar may take oath as Bihar CM on Sunday with BJP support: Report,"JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar is likely to take oath as Bihar Chief Minister with BJP's support, NDTV said in a report. 







    Mint could not independently verify the report. 




   Rumours have strife that Kumar is likely to join hands with PM Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid his deepening differences with INDIA bloc allies.      Is Nitish Kumar returning to NDA? A guide to what's happening in Bihar politics    On Thursday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah held meetings with Bihar BJP president Samrat Choudhary and other senior leaders from the state, including Sushil Modi and Vijay Kumar Sinha in Delhi as the buzz grew that they are open to welcoming Kumar back into their fold.    Bihar's longest-serving chief minister has been cut up with the INDIA bloc for not getting a position in the alliance commensurate with his stature and also favours an early assembly poll to go with the Lok Sabha elections.  INDIA ally Nitish Kumar may return to NDA, but conditions apply: Report    In fact, the INDIA bloc has been marred by incoherence and distrust, with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann dealing double blows on Wednesday that their parties, the TMC and AAP respectively, will go solo in the Lok Sabha elections expected in April-May.    Signs of disconnect among the INDIA parties in Bihar will suit the BJP in the run-up to the elections as the same alliance had handed it a big defeat in the 2015 assembly polls before Kumar joined hands again with the BJP-led NDA, which then swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.    Kumar vaulted into the opposition's alliance in 2022 as the BJP grew increasingly assertive following his party's sub-par performance in the 2020 assembly polls.    Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has returned to the national capital amid tension with Kumar, and the INDIA bloc has erupted.    Gandhi has temporarily paused the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and will resume on January 28 from Cooch Behar, West Bengal.

"Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi will be delighted if Mamata Banerjee joins Nyay Yatra: Jairam Ramesh","Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday spoke with West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee today. ""We will find a way forward,"" said Jairam Ramesh amid the Congress-TMC alliance impasse. 







    ""Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi will be delighted if Mamata Banerjee joins Nyay Yatra in West Bengal even if it's for few minutes,"" Jairam Ramesh said ¬†further.¬† 




   ""Congress president Kharge has spoken with her today and we will find a way forward because her objective is the objective of the INDIA bloc which is to defeat the BJP resoundingly in West Bengal and convincingly in other parts of the country,"" he said.        Ramesh said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would be immensely strengthened by her presence.    ""Without her, we cannot fight the BJP in Bengal and the rest of the country. She is the integral, essential pillar of the opposition bloc INDIA. She has played a crucial role in making the INDIA bloc a reality,"" the Congress leader said.    Ramesh's remarks came after Gandhi expressed confidence in the unity of the opposition INDIA bloc in combating injustice nationwide.    The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Gandhi, entered West Bengal on Thursday from Assam through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district. It will take a two-day break on January 26-27 before restarting on January 28.    Banerjee had told reporters on Wednesday, ""I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go it alone in Bengal.""    After Banerjee's sudden comments, the Congress has adopted a conciliatory approach with Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee"".    The CPI (M)-led Left Front, Congress, and the TMC are part of the 28-party INDIA bloc.    In the 2019 elections, the TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and the BJP bagged 18 seats in the state.

"Lok Sabha polls: BJP invites suggestions for manifesto; Indians demand 'GST on fuel, jobs...'","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched its poll campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha Election 2024 with a new slogan, ""Modi ko chunte hai"" (let us choose Prime Minister Narendra Modi). The prime minister also inaugurated multiple development projects worth over  ‚Çπ19,100 crore in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr. But there's more to the BJP's poll campaign. 







    The BJP government, which believes in building an inclusive India, has made attempts to make its 2024 Lok Sabha poll campaign participatory. The political party has sought suggestions from the public to formulate its poll manifesto ahead of elections. ""Your inputs will shape BJP's 2024 election manifesto,"" the BJP's poster read. 




   In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""I invite the youth of India to contribute to the BJP Manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections."" He asked the youth to share their thoughts on the NaMo App.        As part of the initiative, the prime minister said he would also meet ""some of the contributors"" in person and discuss the inputs shared.




   ""Public participation in the political process strengthens a sense of collaboration between the government and the people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged citizens to contribute their suggestions and inputs for the BJP's election manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" one of the blog posts by PM Modi said.    Apart from the NaMo app, people can also share their suggestions in the comment section of the blog post.  What people demanded in first few hours of the campaignSeveral people responded in the comment section of the PM Modi's blog post. One person suggested, ""Incentives for population control and strict norms for more than two children"". Another demanded, ""Education and employment"".    Some others sought ""better health facilities"", while another comment read, ""Agriculture is very important for our Country.. there should be some plans to encourage agriculture, Farming and Farmers to benefit from this"". In a separate comment, a person said, ""We need to take steps for homeless, jobless people without any partiality. Day by day poor make more poor. We need to take more attention (sic).""    There were also demands for ""increase (in) solar subsidies"", ""preserve(ing) the heritage of our country"", ""Chinese-level economic progress"", ""Population control bill, CAA implementation, rojgar (employment) in rural areas"", ""to revise income tax slab need to reduce petrol, diesel and cylinder price"", ""increase tax slab limit"" and ""Increase Judiciary system people intake to clear pending cases"".    Meanwhile, a person shared a list mentioning: ""1. UCC (Uniform Civil Code) implementation 2. Police Reform 3. RTO Reform 4. Land Mafia Removal and Management 5. Kashi & Mathura Temple 6. Faster Trains & Train timing management 7. Creating more jobs and entrepreneurship 8. PoK takeover 9. Better facilities at tourist places 10. More roads 11. Population control law"".¬†    Another suggested bringing petrol and diesel under the GST, ""strict law on freebies to be followed by every state"" and ""financial knowledge in school"".  BJP campaign songLaunching its poll campaign earlier in the day, the BJP released the theme song in a 2-minute, 10-second video, ""Sapne Nahi Haqeeqat Bunte Hai, Tabhi Toh Sab Modi Ko Chunte Hai"" (We don't weave dreams but reality, and that's why everyone chooses Modi).¬†    The campaign was launched at the First Time Voters Conclave, NaMo Navmatdata Sammelan.

"INDIA ally Nitish Kumar may return to BJP-led NDA, but conditions apply: Report","Speculations are rife that Bihar Chief Minister and INDIA bloc ally Nitish Kumar might return to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India Today cited BJP sources as saying on Thursday that the saffron party has set a condition for the JD(U) chief if he wants to return to the alliance. And that condition is that Nitish Kumar must quit as the chief minister, sources said. 







    Meanwhile, Jan Ki Baat, which predicts elections through opinion and exit polls, also cited sources as saying that Nitish Kumar is set to return to the NDA and is currently mulling legal options to dissolve the state assembly. Earlier in the day, sources told NDTV that Nitish Kumar might not join the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra', led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, when it enters his state on January 29. 




   Besides this, Zee News reported that Nitish Kumar may get a place at the Centre.¬†        A series of meetings are reportedly being held in Patna. Times Now reported that JDU leaders will be holding a meeting at Nitish Kumar's house, while RJD leaders are holding a separate meeting at Lalu Yadav's house. Sources told the media house that ‚Äúsenior leaders of the BJP have also been called to Delhi, and Sushil Modi is going to meet Home Minister Amit Shah tonight.""    Amid reports, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said, ""As a BJP worker, I can say that the door to enter into our party is closed for Nitish Kumar. He is an unreliable politician.""    ¬†




 Nitish Kumar, a key figure in the INDIA coalition, switched from the BJP two years ago. JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said on Thursday that Nitish Kumar had appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for awarding 'Bharat Ratna' to Karpoori Thakur.    He told ANI, ‚ÄúNitish Kumar ji appreciated the way Karpoori Thakur did not give MLA ticket to his own son. He also appreciated the PM for awarding 'Bharat Ratna' to Karpoori Thakur.""

"AAP, Congress workers in Chandigarh make a shift to BJP ahead of Lok Sabha polls","In a blow to the INDIA bloc, several Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress members led by Arvind Kejriwal joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Chandigarh on Thursday in preparation for the impending Lok Sabha elections.¬† 







    The formal induction of these workers took place at a ceremony held at the party office in Chandigarh.

This decision sparked protests from both the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, who had formed an alliance for the mayoral elections.    Earlier on January 18, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the cancellation of mayor polls scheduled to be held in Chandigarh on Thursday.    The AAP and Congress accused the BJP of not allowing to hold the mayoral polls in the wake of its ‚Äúimminent defeat"" and also said that they would move the Punjab and Haryana High Court to hold the elections.

Sena Vs Sena: Uddhav Thackeray faction moves SC against Maharashtra Speaker's verdict on disqualification plea,"Uddhav Thackeray's faction of the Shiv Sena moved the Supreme Court on Monday against the Maharashtra Speaker's order rejecting the plea to disqualify MLAs of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's faction, PTI reported. In his verdict last week, Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar had rejected the disqualification petitions filed by both the camps. He also ruled that the faction led by Shinde was the ""real Shiv Sena political party when rival factions emerged on 21st June 2022"". 

















   Uddhav Thackrey and leaders from his camp, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), criticised Narwekar for the verdict and accused him of colluding with Eknath Shinde. Thackeray had earlier raised objection to a meeting between Narwekar and Shinde, just ahead of the verdict in the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification case.¬†        Uddhav Thackeray said the Speaker's verdict was in violation of the Supreme Court order and is a ""ploy to kill democracy"". ¬†He said, ""The way he made Narvekar sit, it was clear that he was in collusion. I had expressed my doubts yesterday that this is a ploy to kill democracy... We will see whether a case of contempt of the Supreme Court can be made out or not.""¬†    According to PTI, the Shiv Sena (UBT) also accused the Maharashtra Speaker of acting like Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's lawyer while giving his ruling on disqualification petitions filed by the warring Sena factions. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is all match-fixing"".    However, Narvekar dismissed the allegation of ""match-fixing"" as ""baseless"" and said he has to perform his other duties being an MLA and member of a legislative board. He said, ‚ÄúThere's no provision under law that says that while the Speaker is adjudicating disqualification petitions, he should not perform his other duties.""    Narvekar even hit out at Uddhav Thackeray's decision to approach the Supreme Court. He said, ‚Äú...just because you approach the court does not mean that the order passed by the Speaker is overturned."" He added that one has ""to establish that it (the verdict) is illegal or untenable in the eyes of the law."" And, the Uddhav Thackeray faction's ""baseless allegations do not substantiate that,"" the Maharashtra Speaker said on January 10.

Why is PM Modi in a hurry to inaugurate Ram Temple? Congress hits out at BJP for ‚Äònot listening‚Äô to Shankaracharyas,"Congress leader Pawan Khera has hit out at ‚Äúthekedar"" Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) for conducting the ‚ÄòPran Prathista‚Äô ceremony in an incomplete Ayodhya Ram Mandir. After four Shankaracharya (religious heads) refused to attend the Ram Temple inauguration in Ayodhya, Congress hit out at BJP commenting ‚Äòwhy are they in a hurry to inaugurate an under-construction building‚Äô. 







    ‚ÄúAll four Shankaracharyas have said clearly that the pranpratishtha of an incomplete temple cannot be done. If this event is not religious, then it is political"", Pawan Khera said.¬† 








       Shankaracharyas cited that the event is not happening adhering to scriptural guidelines for the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony    Taking a jibe at the BJP, Congress leader Alka Lamba, ""Ask them (BJP), why are the Shankaracharyas not going (to attend the Pran Pratishtha ceremony). They said that construction of Ram Mandir is incomplete, why are the BJP and PM in a hurry? Inaugurating the temple while it is under construction and politicising it; it is evident because elections are nearing.""    On a similar note, Karnataka Congress leader Priyank Kharge questioned, ""The four Shankaracharyas and saints are saying that the Ram temple is incomplete. Why is BJP seeking answers from Congress, but not listening to what the Shankaracharyas are saying?""    Meanwhile, Congress party's Chairperson Social Media & Digital Platforms Supriya Shrinate says, ""All four Shankaracharyas have decided to not visit Ayodhya (for pranpratishtha of Ram Temple). But there is no outrage over this. Does this not hurt religion? It is absolutely wrong to do politics over religious rituals. We are not declining a visit (to Ayodhya). We are not going to the 22nd January event in Ayodhya that is being held in the presence of PM Modi and RSS chief. Shankaracharyas are not going to that event either.

    ""Voters don‚Äôt like being taken for granted ‚Äî but can this arrogant ruling party ever understand that?"" Tharoor said in a post on X on Monday. 




   Congress candidate Rupinder Singh Kooner won the Karanpur by-election in Rajasthan on Monday. He defeated Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and Rajasthan minister Surenderpal Singh.        Surendra Pal Singh is the Rajasthan minister in-charge of four departments ‚ÄîAgricultural Marketing, Agricultural Educator, Indira Gandhi Canal Department and Minority Affairs.    ¬†




   As per the Election Commission of India, after the final round of counting, Kooner garnered a total of 94,950 votes (48.55 per cent), while the BJP minister got 83,667 votes (42.78 per cent).    ""The stunning victory of Congress candidate Shri Rupinder Singh Kunnar in the ShriKaranpur by-election in Rajasthan ‚Äî over a BJP candidate who had already been anointed as a Minister in the state cabinet ‚Äî is a portent of things to come,"" Tharoor said.    Former Rajasthan Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot also expressed his satisfaction over the Congress triumph in the Karanpur Assembly constituency in Rajasthan.    ""This election has given several messages...The arrogance of BJP and the manner in which they have abandoned morality...it is like a slap by the people to BJP."" Ashok Gehlot said.    He extended congratulations to Rupinder Singh for his victory in Karanpur and said, ""Hearty congratulations and best wishes to Shri Rupinder Singh Kunar, the Congress candidate. This triumph is a tribute to the public service initiatives of the late Gurmreet Singh Kunar.""    The election for Karanpur was postponed due to the death of Congress candidate and sitting MLA Gurmeet Singh Koonar. The Congress then fielded his son Rupinder Singh Koonar from the seat.    In the Rajasthan Assembly Election 2023, the BJP won 115 seats, whereas Congress formed the opposition in the state with 68 seats.

"AAP-Congress seat-sharing formula: Kejriwal's party offers 3 Delhi seats for 1 in Gujarat, 3 in Haryana, says report","Ahead of Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are working to come up with a seat-sharing formula for key states including Delhi and Punjab. The two parties held a meeting for the same on Monday.¬† 







    The meeting was attended by senior Congress leaders Mukul Wasnik and Ashok Gehlot, members of the seat-sharing committee, AAP leader Sandeep Pathak, and Delhi Cabinet ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj. In addition to Wasnik and Gehlot, Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely and senior party leaders Salman Khurshid and Mohan Prakash also took part. 




   Even though there has been no official announcement about the seat sharing by the two parties, several media reports suggested that the AAP is offering three Lok Sabha seats from Delhi to the Congress. In return, the Arvind Kejriwal-led party is eyeing 1 Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat, 3 in Haryana, and 1 in Goa, reported India Today citing sources.        The Aam Aadmi Party claimed that the decision on seat sharing will come through further meetings. Earlier, PTI had reported citing sources that the AAP has expressed its willingness to contest the Lok Sabha polls in states such as Gujarat Haryana, and Goa.¬†  Several Congress leaders oppose tie-up with AAPAmid discussions between the two parties regarding the seat-sharing formula, the Congress is facing the opposition of its leaders against a tie-up with the AAP. Congress units in Delhi and Punjab are opposed to any truck with the AAP, according to the PTI report.    The AAP leaders remained tight-lipped over the deliberations. However, the sources said both sides discussed the seats they are willing to contest in Delhi.    The AAP wants to contest four of the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, whereas the Congress is willing to field its nominees from the New Delhi, Chandni Chowk, and North East constituencies, sources told PTI.    ""We had a very good meeting. Senior AAP leaders attended the meeting to hold discussions with us on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal. The National Alliance Committee (NAC) formed by the Congress president held discussions with the AAP leaders and a final decision will be taken later,"" Wasnik said after the meeting.    ""We had in-depth discussions regarding seat sharing and on various other topics. We will meet again after a few days and the final discussion on seat sharing will take place. We will give a final shape to the seat-sharing plans later. We will contest the election together with vigorous preparations and defeat the BJP,"" Wasnik, convenor of the Congress's NAC, said.

    In a veiled attack on the BJP, Banerjee raised an objection over ""disregarding people of other communities"". She said, ""Do whatever you want, you are doing a gimmick before the elections, do it, I have no problem but disregarding people of other communities is not right.""

'Temple or hospital?': Bihar Education Minister Chandra Shekhar's remarks on Ram Mandir sparks outcry,"The Opposition INDIA alliance doesn't seem to have any idea on how to counter the massive popularity boost BJP is receiving ahead of the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on 22 January. While some leaders are tight-lipped on the event, others are resorting to counterattack. The Bihar politics is stirred by the recent poster of RJD MLA Fateh Bahadur Singh, which described temples as a ""path to mental slavery."" Bihar Education Minister Chandra Shekhar defended the poster on Monday and cautioned against pseudo-Hinduvaad and pseudo-nationalism. 







    ‚ÄúIf you get injured, where will you go? Temple or hospital? If you want education and want to become an officer, MLA, or MP, will you go to a temple or school? Fateh Bahadur Singh (RJD MLA) said the same thing that had been said by Savitribai Phule. What is wrong here? He quoted Savitribai Phule. Isn't education necessary?..."" Bihar Education Minister Chandra Shekhar said while speaking to ANI on Monday. 




   ""We should be cautious of pseudo-Hinduvaad and pseudo-nationalism...When Lord Ram resides in each one of us and everywhere, where will you go to look for him?...The sites that have been allocated have been made into sites of exploitation, used for filling the pockets of a few conspirators in society..."" the minister added.¬†    




 Fateh Bahadur Singh's mental slavery posterThe development comes as another Bihar leader and RJD MLA Fateh Bahadur Singh described temples as a path to ‚Äòmental slavery‚Äô in a poster. The poster coming ahead of the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony was not taken well by the opposition BJP, which claimed that the it was ‚Äúaimed at hurting Hindu sentiments with provocative remarks"".    ‚ÄúThe meaning of temple is the path to mental slavery, while the meaning of school is the path towards light,"" the poster said.¬†    ‚ÄúWhen the bell in the temple tolls, it gives us a message that we are heading towards superstition, hypocrisy, foolishness and ignorance; while the bell in the school points towards logical thinking, scientific approach and march towards light. It is for you to decide which way you want to head,"" the poster added.¬†

"‚ÄòThis is India‚Äôs moment‚Äô: PM Modi talks about his management style, says ‚Äòthe final destination‚Ä¶‚Äô","Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes that the ""latent potential"" of India has been unleased in recent years as the government eyes a $5 trillion economy. The senior politician touched upon a wide range of issues ‚Äì from his governance agenda to the ‚Äúroad ahead towards making India the world‚Äôs third largest economy"" during a recent media interaction. The remarks come even as the Narendra Modi-led government intensifies its efforts to secure a third tem in office during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. 







    ‚ÄúWhen I start something, I know the endpoint. But I never announce the final destination or blueprint in the beginning. So, what you see today is not what I‚Äôve worked on. A far bigger picture will unfold finally. I work on a big canvas. Like an artist, I start from one point, but at the time the final picture can‚Äôt be seen,"" the PM told India Today.¬† 




   The PM underscored his point using the Statue of Unity as an example. The 182-foot structure had faced flak from several quarters with many accusing the government of pandering tto a community ahead of polls.¬†        ‚ÄúBut see how it has developed into an entire tourism ecosystem, with something for people of all age groups and interests. Just a couple of days back, it saw 80,000 visitors in one day, this is the level of its popularity. I had promised only one thing, but I delivered dozens of things there. This is my working style,"" Modi added.    The BJP-led government, he explained, believed in ‚Äúachieving national goals through jan andolans"" and believed in the ‚Äúoptimum utilisation of resources and outcome-oriented monitoring"". Modi also said that he formulated policies and strategies after listening to ‚Äúall the economists and experts"" and then taking his ‚Äúground connect"" and the ‚Äúlived reality of India"" into account.

PM Modi appeared to concur, insisting that his track record over the past two decades ‚Äúspoke for itself"".    ¬†‚Äú‚Ä¶when I became PM in 2014, the size of India‚Äôs economy was $2 trillion ( ‚Çπ167 lakh crore) and at the end of 2023-24, India‚Äôs GDP will be more than $3.75 trillion ( ‚Çπ312 lakh crore). It is this track record of 23 years which shows this is a realistic target‚Ä¶Today, the world consensus is clear: this is India‚Äôs moment.,"" he added.    ¬†

Buzz in Congress circles on Sonia Gandhi taking RS route to parliament,"New Delhi | Bengaluru: Congress circles are abuzz with a growing suspense on whether Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi will opt for a Rajya Sabha berth this time instead of contesting from Raebareli, which she has represented in the Lok Sabha since 2004.Budget 2024Budget at a glance: Your 2-minute guide to become a Budget ProWhile there is nothing official about it yet, many Gandhi family loyalists among the Congress leaders have started whispering that it's better the 77-year-old Gandhi avoid another Lok Sabha poll contest given her ""poor health"". Some of them also feel her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is best suited to contest and guard ""the Gandhi family seat"" of Raebareli (even though some Vadra campers have been pitching for Priyanka seeking an RS berth) while Rahul Gandhi can try to wrest Amethi with or without contesting from the second (safe) seat of Wayanad.It is also a fact that after BJP wrested Rahul's Amethi seat last time, the saffron party is working hard to storm Raebareli, the lone Congress sitting seat in UP, in the 2024 poll. Congress could win one RS seat each from Himachal, Rajasthan and Maharashtra and the party is in a position to win about 3-4 seats from Karnataka and Telangana. It remains to be seen whether the Congress circles will work the typical chorus for Sonia Gandhi's entry into the RS when nomination time approaches.Meanwhile, Karnataka PCC chief DK Shivakumar on Tuesday sought to put at rest talks of Gandhi entering the Rajya Sabha from the state and claimed there had been no such discussion.

ED has alleged that Katyal is a close aide of Prasad and his family.The agency had earlier this month filed a charge sheet against former Bihar CM Rabri Devi, her MP daughter Misa Bharti and another daughter Hema Yadav in the same case.

"14 states, 150 days, 355 constituencies: Bharat Nyay Yatra is Rahul Gandhi's last chance to walk the talk before polls","After the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs decisive Assembly election victories in three Hindi-heartland states, the 2024 game is looking settled. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more than confident about getting a third tenure and is already making promises about his next stint at the top post. The Congress has to swallow some bitter pills, as the defeat reduces their leverage amongst other parties of the INDIA alliance. In his last chance to revive the fortunes of the Congress party ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is embarking on the second leg of his pan-India march, the ‚ÄòBharat Nyay Yatra‚Äô. 







    The Bharat Nyay Yatra comes as Rahul Gandhi received tremendous support for its ‚ÄòBharat Jodo Yatra‚Äô which the Congress MP started in September 2022 from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. This time Rahul Gandhi will undertake a 150-day-long Bharat Nyay Yatra from Manipur in the northeast to Mumbai in western India. 




   ‚ÄúThis Yatra will cover a distance of 6,200 km. It travels the states including Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, UP, MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat and finally Maharashtra. The mode of yatra is through the bus,"" Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal said while announcing the Bharat Nyay Yatra.      Bharat Nyay Yatra: The Lok Sabha calculusRahul Gandhi‚Äôs Bharat Nyay Yatra, which will conclude just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, seems to be a well-thought-out plan. It remains to be seen if the impact of this Yatra will convert into numbers, but the route of the march covers most of the Lok Sabha seats of North India, especially where the Congress has shown a disastrous performance in the previous two Lok Sabha elections.    The Congress leader will cover 14 states during the Bharat Nyay Yatra and it includes crucial states like West Bengal (42 Lok Sabha seats), Bihar (40 seats), Uttar Pradesh (80 seats), Madhya Pradesh (29 seats), Rajasthan (25 seats), Gujarat (26 seats) and Maharashtra (48 seats). The march will also include Chhattisgarh (11 seats) which the Congress recently lost to the BJP.    Overall, the Bharat Nyay Yatra will cover 355 Lok Sabha seats which is 65% of the total parliamentary seats in the country. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 236 of the 355 seats while the Congress managed to win only 14.  Bharat Nyay Yatra: The alliance managementApart from an attempt to regain its lost glory in the Hindi-heartland states, the Congress is also looking to send a message to the other parties of the INDIA alliance. Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Bharat Jodo Yatra was successful in attracting a huge crowd and hence more cameras. So, when the former Congress president gets that sort of media attention in West Bengal or Uttar Pradesh, its alliance partner may get a signal from the Congress asserting its support base in these states.    In the recently concluded meeting of the INDIA alliance, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee proposed the name of Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge as the prime minister candidate of the Opposition front. While some political pundits can‚Äôt stop themselves from calling it a move to sacrifice Mallikarjun Kharge in a no-brainer election, others still live in the La La Land of Congress making a comeback.

"‚Äò ‚Çπ40,000 crore scam': Karnataka BJP MLA vows to expose Covid corruption charges against BS Yediyurappa if‚Ä¶","Disgruntled Vijayapura BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal yet again lashed out at former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and accused him of a massive  ‚Çπ40,000 crore corruption in the COVID-19 management in the state.¬† 







    ""Do you know how many thousands of crores of rupees was looted in this (Covid)? There is  ‚Çπ40,000 crore irregularities during Covid-19 outbreak,"" Yatnal claimed, PTI reported. 




   As many BJP leaders have been demanding action against him, Yatnal said, ""They (the BJP government in Karnataka) have done everything (huge corruption during Covid). Let them serve me a notice and try to expel me from the party, I will expose them.""        ""A mask that costs  ‚Çπ45 each, Mr Yediyurappa how much did your government spend on each of them during Covid? They had put a price of  ‚Çπ485 for each mask...,"" the agitated BJP MLA said in Vijayapura.    ""They (BJP government) said they arranged 10,000 beds in Bengaluru. The rent for these beds...remember that it was taken only on rent‚Ä¶if they had purchased then two beds could have been bought (for the same price). They paid  ‚Çπ20,000 as rent per day. Two cots with saline stands could have been purchased with  ‚Çπ20,000. Do you know how much they spent a day during corona?"" Yatnal further said.    Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said Yatnal's statement was proof of large-scale corruption during Covid time.    He said the Congress when in the opposition had called a press conference and alleged with documents that the Yediyurappa government had committed corruption to the tune of around  ‚Çπ4,000 crore in the name of coronavirus treatment and control.  Covid: 34 cases of JN.1 variant in KarnatakaKarnataka Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao has said that there are 34 cases of JN.1 variant of COVID-19 in the state but the government is well prepared and nothing is ""alarming.""

"Ram Mandir is BJP‚Äôs ‚Äòshow-off‚Äô, says Kapil Sibal: Saffron party‚Äôs behaviour ‚Äònowhere close to Ram's‚Äô","Kapil Sibal recently spoke about his personal spirituality and views on current political events. The Rajya Sabha MP expressed his devotion to Lord Ram, stating that Ram's presence in his heart guides his actions and beliefs. 







    ""I have Ram in my heart. I don't need to show off. What I say to you is from my heart because I do not care about all these things. If Ram is in my heart and Ram has guided me throughout my journey, it means that I have done something right,"" Sibal told ANI.

Sibal emphasised that his faith is a personal matter, not requiring public display.        Sibal criticised the Centre's approach to the Ram Mandir construction. He labelled it as a ‚Äúshow-off"". He compared the BJP's actions with Lord Ram's qualities like honesty, tolerance and respect. According to him, while the saffron party praises Ram in public, their actions don't match Ram's teachings. He urged that Ram's principles should guide one's actions, reflecting in adherence to constitutional goals.

"‚ÄòNo alternative to PM Narendra Modi in country as of now,‚Äô claims Ajit Pawar","Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said that currently, there is ‚Äúno alternative"" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the country. 







    As reported by PTI, Pawar's response came when reporters inquired about opposition parties contemplating a challenge to Modi's leadership in anticipation of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls next year. 




   ‚ÄúAs of now, there is no alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the country. Such a decision is taken based on various aspects and not just one or two things,"" Pawar said.        Also Read: NCP leader counters 'fiefdom' jibe from Ajit Pawar-led faction, says Sharad Pawar 'stood behind you like a rock'    ‚ÄúYou people do a lot of propaganda,"" he told the mediapersons.

Also Read: 'Ajit Pawar not our leader,' Sharad Pawar takes U-turn after 'no conflict, no split in party' remark    ""We have also seen results (of recent assembly polls) in three states - Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. A guesswork before the elections does not mean results will be the same,"" he said.    The BJP emerged victorious in the polls held in these three states.    In response to questions about opposition parties organizing rallies in the Pune district against the state government, Pawar mentioned that a Lok Sabha MP from the NCP had indicated his readiness to resign as a member of the Lower House of Parliament.    Also Read: 'PM Modi's charisma would benefit Maharashtra': Ajit Pawar amid speculations of joining Sharad Pawar    ‚ÄúWhen we gave him a ticket in 2019, he was popular because he played the role of Sambhaji Maharaj (in a TV serial) and was a good orator,"" he said apparently referring to Amol Kolhe, the Lok Sabha member from Shirur constituency in Pune who supports the NCP camp led by Sharad Pawar.    ""I have decided on an alternative to him (in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls), and I can tell you now that my candidate will win the seat for sure,"" said Ajit Pawar, who along with eight other NCP leaders joined the Eknath Shinde-led state government in July this year.

"No ‚Äònegative campaigning‚Äô, Ram Temple: How BJP is strategising a ‚Äòstunning‚Äô victory in 2024 LS polls. 10 things to know","After a stupendous victory in assembly polls in 3 states - Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, BJP has set its sights on winning an ""unprecedented majority"" in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.¬† 







    Keeping this as the vision, in a recent meeting, senior BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi, chalked out key strategies ahead of the elections.¬† 




   During the meeting, PM Modi urged key organisational leaders to work towards boosting the party's vote share by 10%, while Home Minister Amit Shah said that the BJP's performance should leave the opposition ‚Äústunned"".        ""We have to reach every home with our ideology and historic works of BJP governments and make Modi ji prime minister again in 2024 with an unprecedented majority,"" Shah later posted on X about his address at the meet.  Here are the key things discussed during the meeting:Modi called for raising the BJP's vote share by 10% from its show in the 2019 polls when the ruling party had fetched over 37% of votes while the National Democratic Alliance led by it had bagged around 45% votes.The party's top brass did not set any specific seat target but emphasised on ensuring a win which should be bigger than its 2019 performance when the BJP had bagged 303 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats.Party leaders have been advised to reach out to first-time voters¬†The prime minister also emphasised the need to reach out to women, youth, farmers and the poor - whom he has often described as the four biggest ""castes"".He asked party leaders to connect a maximum number of these people with the ongoing 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra', which aims at saturation of his government's flagship welfare schemes.Senionr party leaders have also been advised focus on spreading the word about the government's positive works instead of joining issues with opposition parties in their ""negative"" campaign.The consecration ceremony at the Ram temple was one of the highlights of the two-day deliberations as the party is confident it will be a major issue in its favour in the polls.Modi's leadership, the appeal of his government's welfare schemes and the strength of its organisational machinery were cited as big reasons for the win.Different 'morchas' of the party spoke about their upcoming programmes in the run-up to the general elections.The BJP's big win in the recent assembly polls came up for praise in the meeting, with the party unit presidents of the three Hindi heartland states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh speaking on the victories.(With inputs from PTI)

"2024 election: Google to restrict queries from Bard, AI-based search","Google will restrict election-related queries from Bard and AI-based searches, Reuters reported. The announcement from the Alphabet company comes ahead of the pivotal 2024 US Presidential election. 







    While the US election garners global attention, 2024 is also crucial for other nations. India and South Africa, among others, are gearing up for national elections. Google aims to focus more on how AI could impact these elections. It indicates a shift towards more responsible AI usage in political contexts.

Madhya Pradesh: Row erupts after man dressed as Lord Hanuman welcomes CM Mohan Yadav at Ujjain event,"A controversy erupted after a person dressed as Lord Hanuman welcomed newly appointed Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav at an event in Ujjain. 







    The video footage of the incident showed the person mimicking flying to welcome Yadav with a garland. 




   After the incident, the video went viral on social media.        In the footage, the person was seen hanging from a crane to welcome Yadav at the event where a huge crowd had gathered for the entry ceremony of the CM on Saturday.    The Congress party has slammed the act and questioned the need for it.    ‚ÄúIsn't the blood of hypocrites boiling by hanging Bajrang Bali on a crane and welcoming the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh with his hands? Crossed all limits,"" Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).    After his name was announced for the MP CM post, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had levelled some allegations against him on X.    ‚ÄúEight days after the election results, the BJP elected the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, a person against whom there are many serious allegations including large-scale manipulation in the Ujjain Master Plan,"" Ramesh said.    ¬†




   He also alleged that the MP government allegedly changed the land-use pattern in the Ujjain Master Plan to benefit Yadav.    On Monday, a four-day first session of the 16th Madhya Pradesh Assembly started with newly elected MLAs, including CM Mohan Yadav administering oath.    Protem Speaker Gopal Bhargava administered the oath to the MLAs and Yadav.    Addressing the media after taking oath, Yadav said, ‚ÄúToday is the first day of the 16th Assembly session. We all newly elected MLAs, including me, took the oath and kept it continuing. I am happy that on the very first day, we have given a positive message. The nomination form for the new Assembly Speaker has been submitted. I welcome this positive cooperation of the opposition and hope that they will play their positive, constructive role in the development of the state.""

"Smriti Irani takes jibe at Arvind Kejriwal, says ‚Äòhe sent half of his cabinet to jail, no guarantee on..‚Äô","Union Minister Smriti Irani on Sunday took a jibe at the AAP-led Delhi government, whose most of the ministers are currently behind bars. Taking a jibe at CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Amethi MP said that he has sent half of his cabinet ministers to jail, now there is no guarantee how long he will stay out of prison.¬† 







    Her remark came at a public meeting held in Delhi in the presence of BJP leader Manoj Tiwari. 




   ‚ÄúI know you (BJP leader Manoj Tiwari) and the district president have no expectations from the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government. The person who has already sent half of his cabinet to jail, there is no guarantee on how long he (Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal) will stay out,"" said Irani on Sunday, according to ANI.

Earlier, the Delhi CM has said on many occasions that he would be arrested.¬†    ‚ÄúSimultaneous to the summons, in the afternoon of 30.10.2023, BJP leaders started making statements that soon I would be summoned and arrested. By the evening of that day, I received your summons,"" said Kejriwal after receiving ED summons in November.    He also accused that the ED summons was ‚Äúleaked to select BJP leaders to malign image and reputation and has been issued at the behest of the ruling party at the Centre.""    He also claimed that BJP MP Manoj Tiwari had ‚Äúopenly"" said, on the day the summons was issued to Kejriwal -- that the chief minister would be arrested.    Earlier this, the party ran a campaign asking people if Delhi CM should leave his CM post if he is arrested or run the government from jail.   ARVIND                    More Information

   Earlier in the day, Soren had lodged an FIR against senior Enforcement Directorate personnel at the SC/ST police station here over searches conducted by the agency at his Delhi residence, officials said on Wednesday.

"Chandigarh Mayor polls protest: Traffic hit as AAP, BJP supporters clash at Delhi's DDU Marg","Commuters had a harrowing time crossing the DDU Marg in Central Delhi as the ruling AAP and opposition BJP mounted demonstrations against each other, a few hundred metres apart, over allegations of rigging of Chandigarh polls and corruption in the city administration. 







    Police had a hard time containing thousands of men and women from both sides who milled around barricades, raising slogans and waving placards. 




   By 11 am, the Delhi BJP workers and leaders led by state president Virendra Sachdeva were gathered near Andhra Education Society school at ITO. Just a few hundred metres away, the AAP volunteers led by party national convener Arvind Kejriwal congregated at BJP headquarters on the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg.        Though police had beefed up security and raised barricades on and around the stretch, it proved difficult for them to control the protestors as they tried to remove the barricades to move ahead, that led to detention of many.    Each side rent the air with slogans like ""Vote Chor BJP"" and ""Kejriwal Istifa Do.""    Motorists and other commuters had to go around a barricaded DDU Marg and negotiate a choked Minto Road, even as the crowd spilled into the nearby roads and lanes.    The BJP raised slogans demanding Kejriwal voluntarily present himself before the Enforcement Directorate if innocent, while AAP called BJP a ""thief"" and accused it of abusing the central agencies to lock up its rivals.    Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Bhagwant Mann reached the AAP office around 1 am to boost morale of the party volunteers who greeted them with loud cheers and slogans.    Kejriwal and Mann slammed the BJP over alleged rigging of Chandigarh mayoral polls held last week. The party volunteers started chanting ""Gali Gali Mein Shor Hai, BJP Vote Chor Hai"" after Kejriwal gave the slogan addressing the protesters.    Police detained dozens of protesters from both the parties when they tried to remove the barricades.

    Speaking to India Today, he said, ‚ÄúLook at whoever is advising them. This could be the worst time for you to leave headquarters and go for a yatra."" 




   Kishor cited that the yatra should have been conducted six months to a year before elections, and further stressed the need to focus on strategic allies, finalising candidates and campaign strategy.        ‚ÄúWhen you are needed at headquarters, you are in the field. When you needed to be in the field then you were sitting in Delhi. I don't know who advises them,"" Kishor said.    Along similar lines, Kishor told Indian Express that he finds no logic in Rahul Gandhi's Manipur-to-Mumbai yatra. ‚ÄúAt a time when he should be at the centre of where politics happen, he is busy doing a Yatra in the Northeast. Visiting the areas is fine but deserting the headquarters is definitely not a wise move. I don‚Äôt know who is advising him on these issues.""    The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' which started in Manipur on January 14, will cover to traverse 6,713 km over 67 days, spanning 110 districts in 15 states, concluding in Mumbai on March 20. ¬†The dates are very close to the Lok Sabha elections, which are likely to be held between April and May.¬†  Why is it a critical time INDI alliance?¬†The statement holds significance as Congress is receiving flak from some INDIA bloc allies over ‚Äòseat-sharing‚Äô deals. In Bihar, Nitish Kumar ditched the Mahagathbandhan and formed a new government in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party it also severed ties with the opposition alliance.¬†    Meanwhile, in Bengal, TMC has declared that it will contest the Lok Sabha elections ‚Äòsolo‚Äô. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that she was keen on a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress but it joined hands with the CPI(M) to assist the BJP in the elections, forcing her to go it alone in the Lok Sabha polls.    ¬†    ¬†    ¬†

FM Sitharaman says Modi govt will soon present white paper on economic mismanagement under UPA: ‚ÄòWe lost 10 glorious‚Ä¶‚Äô,"To bring forth the situation of economic mismanagement before 2014 during the Congress-led UPA government, the Modi government is likely to table a White Paper in the parliament next week. 







    In her interim budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the central government would release a ‚ÄòWhite Paper‚Äô comparing the state of the Indian economy before and after 2014. 




   The white paper is expected to be presented at the parliament next week, a senior government official told PTI. In an interaction with Network 18, FM Sitharaman said that the white paper will focus on the mismanagement of the economy during the previous regime. It will also talk about the impact of positive steps that could have been taken at that time.        ""We lost 10 glorious years... Every area of the economy was ridden by problems from banks to minerals,"" Network 18 quoted FM Sitharaman.    ""It is now appropriate to look at where we were then till 2014 and where we are now, only to draw lessons from the mismanagement of those years. The government will lay a White Paper on the table of the House,"" announced Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman while presenting the interim Budget for the next financial year on Thursday.    During her Budget speech, the Finance Minister said that the responsibility of the Modi government to mend the economy step-by-step and to put the governance systems in order was enormous.¬†    ""The economy got a new vigour. The fruits of development started reaching the people at scale. The country got a new sense of purpose and hope. Naturally, the people blessed the government with a bigger mandate (2019),"" she said.    ""The government did that successfully following our strong belief of 'nation-first',"" Sitharaman added.    The Budget session of Parliament began on Wednesday. It will be the last session of the parliament of the 17th Lok Sabha before the General Elections in the coming months.

'We will not tolerate..': Mallikarjun Kharge on Congress MP's 'separate country' remark,"Congress President and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday said irrespective of which party, speaking about splitting the country will never be tolerated. 







    Kharge was reacting to Union Minister Piyush Goyal's demand for an apology from the Congress for a controversial statement by party MP DK Suresh, who allegedly suggested a call for a separate south nation over fiscal injustice. 




   Kharge said, ""If he has said anything, the matter should be looked into by the privileges committee (of Lok Sabha).""¬†        ""We will not tolerate any statement that calls for breaking the country. That statement may be from any party... be it from my party or their (BJP) party, or somebody else. Someone says or not, I Mallikarjun Kharge, will state that India is one from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and will remain one. It is for this cause that Indira Gandhi gave the supreme sacrifice of her life and Rajiv Gandhi gave his life. Can such a party talk of breaking the country? We will not tolerate such a thing.""  ALSO READ: Mallikarjun Kharge criticises Nirmala Sitharaman's budget for 2024: ‚ÄòOnly for day-to-day affairs‚Äô    It is not correct to repeat in the House what Suresh has not said, he added.    Earlier, Kharge said Suresh is not a member of the Rajya Sabha and, therefore, his conduct cannot be debated in the House. To this, Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar, however, said his earlier rulings had made it clear that the statement by a Lok Sabha MP can be discussed in the Upper House.  What did Goyal allege?Goyal raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha and said the statement by DK Suresh, who is the brother of Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, reflects the 'divisive' thinking of the Congress party.    Without naming Suresh, Goyal said the statement cannot be ignored as it is an attack on the Constitution of India and an insult to the sovereignty and integrity of the country.    ""The Congress president should clarify if the party is associated with the statement. (He should also state if) the country's sovereignty and integrity and its Constitution hold any place in the mindset of the Congress. (And that) does the party want to divide the country into north and south?"" he said.    ""The country will not tolerate this divisive approach of the Congress. I condemn the Congress party and its leaders and demand that they apologise for the statement.""    Goyal said Suresh made the statements on a day when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was presenting the interim Budget.  What Suresh saidWhile commenting on the Union Interim Budget 2024-25 presented in Parliament on Thursday, DK Suresh had allegedly said that ""injustice was being served to South India"".    ""Funds that were supposed to reach the South are getting diverted and distributed to North India,"" he claimed.    Later, Suresh posted a thread on X (formerly Twitter) clarifying his remarks.    ""A proud Indian and a proud Kannadiga! South India and especially Karnataka have faced the brutality of injustice in funds distribution. Even after being the 2nd largest GST-contributing state, the Centre has been utterly unjust to Karnataka and Southern states while states like Gujarat have seen a 51 per cent hike. If this is not injustice, then what is?"" he asked.    ""We are sons of this soil and need funds for our developmental activities. Even after repeated requests for funds for developmental activities and drought relief, the Centre has continued to turn a deaf ear to us,"" he added.    DK Suresh mentioned that he stands by the unity and integrity of India as a ‚Äúproud Indian and Congressman"".    ""I shall also continue to raise my voice against injustice towards Karnataka, no matter what. Jai Hind! Jai Karnataka,"" he said.  With agency inputs.

"'I need new haters...': Mallikarjun Kharge's ‚Äòab 400 Paar‚Äô remark in Rajya Sabha makes PM Modi laugh, video goes viral","Congress President and Leader of Opposition Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday in a satirical way addressed the House saying Bhartiya Janata Party will cross 400 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections 2024. Following this, this video has gone viral on social media. 







    Kharge's reference to the ruling BJP ‚ÄòAbki Baar, 400 Paar‚Äô evoked laughter among those seated on the Treasury bench, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 




   In a clip shared by BJP's official X handle, Kharge could be heard saying, ""You have a majority, with 330-334 seats. This time, it will be above 400."" BJP's official X handle gave a header for the tweet, saying, ""PM Modi be like, ""I need new haters, the old ones have become my fans...""      ALSO READ: Mallikarjun Kharge criticizes Nirmala Sitharaman's budget for 2024: ‚ÄòOnly for day-to-day affairs‚Äô  Here's the video clip:




 BJP's 2024 Lok Sabha elections target:This time, BJP is aiming to achieve its highest-ever seat tally in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, surpassing its 2019 performance of 303 seats.    Recently, the party, led by Jagat Prakash Nadda launched its election campaign with a theme song highlighting the NDA government's achievements.    On 26 January, the song ‚ÄúSapne Nahi Haqeeqat Bunte Hai, Tabhi Toh Sab Modi Ko Chunte Hain (we do not spin dreams, but weave reality, which is why people choose Modi)"" was launched in the PM‚Äôs presence by Nadda.    ""The conditions that prevailed in the country 10-12 years ago made the future look bleak. You may not even be aware of the conditions of those times. The generation before 2014 had given up hope about the possibilities we are talking about today,"" the prime minister had said.    Earlier in 2019, the BJP had coined the slogan ‚ÄòPhir Ek Baar Modi Sarkar [Once more, Modi government]‚Äô ahead of the polls to seek a second term for the NDA administration.    Also, Union Minister Piyush Goyal during the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2023 had predicted the NDA to win over 400 seats in the upcoming LS elections. He had even claimed that BJP would win all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state.  With agency inputs.

"‚ÄòPerfectly okay if leaders like Himanta, Milind‚Äô leave Congress as...: Rahul Gandhi amid Baba Siddique exit reports","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is perfectly okay with people like Himanta Biswa Sarma and Milind Deora leaving the grand old party as their politics is very different. 







    ""I want people like Himanta and Milind to leave. I am perfectly okay with it. Himanta represents a particular type of politics that is not Congress' politics. Have you seen some of the statements Himanta makes about Muslims? There are certain values that I would like to defend,"" Rahul Gandhi said. 




   The Congress leader was interacting with 'digital media warriors' in West Bengal during his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, the video of which was uploaded to his account on Friday.        ¬†




   Tensions escalated between Rahul Gandhi and Himanta Biswa Sarma during Rahul's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam. Himanta accused Rahul of instigating unrest on January 22, and following this, Rahul Gandhi labeled Assam CM as the 'most corrupt CM' in India.    In the same conversation, Rahul Gandhi mentioned Milind Deora, a former Congress leader from Maharashtra, who left the party to join the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde after disagreements over seat-sharing in Maharashtra. The disagreement involved the Congress, Uddhav's Shiv Sena, and Sharad Pawar's NCP, set to contest elections together. Milind Deora's desired Mumbai South seat went to Uddhav Sena due to a sitting MP.    The statement holds significance as it comes at a time when the Maharashtra Congress may get another setback with the speculated exit of Baba Siddique.  Congress-TMC seat-sharing talksGandhi said his party was discussing the seat-sharing arrangements for the Lok Sabha polls with the ruling TMC in West Bengal, and the issue would be ""resolved"".    Gandhi made the comment while interacting with the party's 'digital media warriors' in West Bengal on Thursday night.    Asked why the Congress was giving importance to TMC chairperson Mamata Banerjee despite her unwillingness to leave a single Lok Sabha seat for the Congress in the state, Gandhi said, ""Neither Mamata-ji has said, nor the Congress has come out of the alliance (sic).""    ""Even Mamata-ji is saying that she is in the alliance. Seat negotiations are on from both ends. It will be resolved,"" he said during the interaction, a video of which was shared on X.    On Thursday, Banerjee said that she was keen on a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress but it joined hands with the CPI(M) to assist the BJP in the elections, forcing her to go it alone in the Lok Sabha polls.

"Who can steer BJP after PM Modi? Ahead of Lok Sabha 2024, Prashant Kishor says party's biggest risk is...","Political strategist Prashant Kishor on Friday said the ""biggest risk"" for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is its ""overdependence"" on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In an interview with the Indian Express, Kishor said, ‚ÄúIt is overdependence on PM Modi that is their biggest problem now."" 







    Speaking at the ‚ÄòExpress Adda‚Äô event, Kishor was also asked whether the Mandal and Ram Mandir issues will be in mind over PM Modi in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.¬† 




   Responding to the question, he said, ‚ÄúThe votes will definitely be around PM Modi. Yes, the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is big, but if you remove PM Modi from the equation, even the BJP will agree that it would have not been as effective as it is.""        When asked as to who might come after PM Modi, Prashant Kishor said, ""That I wouldn‚Äôt know but whoever it is, will be more hardliner than he is‚Ä¶He/she would make Modi look relatively liberal than what he/she is going to be.""¬†    His statement has come when the Lok Sabha elections are around the corner. The general elections in India are set to take place this year. The Election Commission of India is yet to announce the dates.  Prashant Kishor's advice to Congress and INDIA blocDuring his interview, Prashant Kishor also lent a piece of advice for the Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. He said, ""I had told them that they would need to re-incarnate themselves.""  ALSO READ: Lok Sabha 2024 a ‚Äòbattle of ideologies‚Äô: Congress could be a game-changer if...    Explaining this further, the strategist added, ""...One cannot keep jumping from one goal to another. Today, it is Rafale, tomorrow, Hindutva...this won‚Äôt work. They need to stick to one belief and strive towards dispensing that message.""    He added that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has more reach on social media than many members of the BJP but he is not reaching the people as much because he is not saying the right things.    On the Opposition's alliance, Prashant Kishor said the INDIA bloc ""is clearly not serious enough"".    ""If the Opposition parties were serious enough, they should have come together much earlier and did a lot more than they did since June 2023...All the INDIA alliance has done from June 2023, when they first met, to now is conduct closed-door meetings,"" Kishor added.

Soren challenged the ED's summons dated January 22, 2024, and January 25, 2024, purportedly issued under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, as illegal, null, and void, and accordingly quash the impugned summons and all steps taken and proceedings emanating therefrom.  'Hemant Soren illegally possessed 8.5 acres land,' alleges ED    The JMM chief claimed that he has been facing constant harassment at the hands of the ED, alleging that the probe agency was misusing its authority and powers at the bidding of its political masters.    Separately, JMM legislature Champai Soren on Friday took oath as the chief minister of Jharkhand.    He was administered the oath of office by Governor C P Radhakrishnan at the Raj Bhavan in ranchi.    The 67-year-old tribal leader was sworn in as the 12th chief minister of the state. He became the sixth CM from Jharkhand‚Äôs Kolhan region which comprises East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts.    Champai Soren was nominated for the chief minister's post on Thursday after he urged the governor to accept his claim to form the government at the earliest as there was ""confusion"" in the state which was without a chief minister since the resignation of Hemant Soren on Wednesday, deepening the political crisis.    Champai Soren has been given 10 days to prove his government's majority.

Former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren sent to 5-day ED custody,"Former Jharkhand Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party (JMM) executive president Hemant Soren was sent to 5-day Directorate of Enforcement (ED) custody on Friday. 







    Soren was arrested on January 31 by the ED in connection with a money laundering case related to the ‚Äúillegal"" possession of extensive land parcels and his alleged involvement with the ‚Äúland mafia."" Following his arrest, a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Ranchi remanded him to one-day judicial custody on Thursday. 




   Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court declined to intervene in the arrest of an individual by the ED in connection with a money laundering case. The court directed the individual, represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi, to approach the high court for any relief. The special bench comprised Justices Sanjiv Khanna, MM Sundresh, and Bela M Trivedi.        Sibal said, ‚ÄúIn these kinds of cases, this court needs to send a message. Here, we are dealing with a chief minister, who has been arrested. Please see the evidence. This is not fair""    Also Read: ‚ÄòKejriwal is next‚Äô: BJP MP warns after Jharkhand ex-CM Hemant Soren's ED arrest in land fraud case    Soren said in the petition that he was arrested at the Raj Bhavan, where he had gone to submit his resignation as the chief minister, accompanied by JMM MLAs and those from allied parties who collectively hold a clear majority in the state assembly.    ‚ÄúThe arrest of the petitioner around 10.10 PM on January 31, 2024 is illegal and malafide and without jurisdiction,"" it claimed.    The petition argued that Soren's arrest had infringed upon his freedom, asserting that the officers of the ED had misused their authority for external motives, influenced by the directives of the Central government.    Meanwhile, amidst the political turmoil in Jharkhand, Champai Soren, a leader from the JMM, was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Jharkhand on Friday at the Raj Bhavan in Ranchi.

With the combined support of 43 MLAs, the alliance known as the INDIA bloc appears to have the necessary numbers to successfully navigate through a floor test.  (With inputs from PTI)

Supreme Court asks Hemant Soren to approach HC against ED arrest in money laundering case,"Supreme Court on Friday refused to interfere with arrest of former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren by ED in money laundering case. The apex court asked Soren to approach High Court for relief. 







    A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, MM Sundresh and Bela Trivedin insisted Kapil Sibal and AM Singhvi that Soren must move to Jharkhand High Court for bail. In his plea before the apex court, Soren has urged it to declare his arrest as unwarranted, arbitrary, and in violation of his fundamental rights.

A look at seat equation        The Enforcement Directorate arrested Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren on Wednesday night pertaining to charges related to a land scam case.

"‚ÄòNot ready to form alliance with CPI(M), they killed lakhs of people‚Äô: Mamata Banerjee","While growing disagreements over seat-sharing have put the Opposition alliance at risk of collapsing, West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, said on Thursday that her party, in collaboration with similar regional allies, is poised to establish the government at the Centre following the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. 







    However, Banerjee categorically dismissed the possibility of allying with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M). She asserted that the CPI(M) had been responsible for orchestrating the killings of Opposition activists during its rule in the state. 




   ‚ÄúI can assure you all that we will form the government in Delhi. As to how or in what manner we form the government at the Centre is something we will decide after the (Lok Sabha) elections through talks with like-minded regional parties,"" the TMC Supremo said, as reported by ANI.        Also Read: How TMC's Mamata Banerjee plans to win LS polls ‚Äòsolo‚Äô    Ruling out trucking with the Left, which is a partner in the INDIA bloc, for the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, she added, ‚ÄúThe CPI(M) killed scores of people when they were in power here. They took lives and wrecked many households. They burned (anti-land acquisition activist) Tapasi Malik alive in Singur. People were set ablaze and their bodies were dumped in the Haldi River of Nandigram. We will never go into an alliance with the CPI(M). They perpetrated similar horrific crimes in Shantipur as well.""




   The West Bengal CM had earlier ruled out allying with the Congress, saying her party was quite capable of going it alone in the state and defeating the BJP-led NDA.    Also Read: Bengal conundrum plaguing INDIA Bloc? Mamata vs Adhir vs CPI(M) cast aspersion ahead of Lok Sabha Polls    Accusations flew as Abhishek Banerjee, a TMC leader and nephew of Mamata Banerjee, pointed fingers at the Congress, holding them responsible for the breakdown in seat-sharing discussions.    Earlier in the week, representatives of various political parties convened in the national capital to deliberate on the seat-sharing agenda for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.    Also Read: 'She is our didi, we respect her‚Äô: INDIA parties deny rift as Mamata Banerjee decides to fight LS polls alone in Bengal    Among those present were Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, DMK leader TR Baalu, and CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury, all captured leaving Kharge's residence after the meeting.    The INDIA bloc faced escalating divisions as Mamata Banerjee distanced herself from the Congress, and Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar dealt another blow to the alliance by rejoining the BJP-led NDA. Nitish, a crucial figure in the bloc, not only withdrew from the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in Bihar but also took oath as chief minister for the ninth time, garnering support from the NDA.    Also Read: 'I can sense a fever, feeling cold': Mamata Banerjee after sustaining minor head injury due to accident    ‚ÄúWe had proposed to give two (Lok Sabha) seats in Malda to the Congress but they didn't agree to that.

Blaming the CPI(M) for her falling out with the Congress over the years, the TMC chief said, ‚ÄúThe CPM is the number one broker of the BJP. I took a lot of beatings from the CPI(M) and will never forgive them. I used to be on good terms with the Congress but my equations soured because of the Left.""  (With inputs from ANI)

‚ÄòJharkhand will not bow down!‚Äô: INDIA bloc slams 'BJP's bullying' after arrest of Hemant Soren,"Members of the INDIA bloc have lashed out at the BJP for ‚Äòbullying‚Äô the Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha ahead of Lok Sabha elections. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused the saffron party of imprisoning opposition leaders to win the upcoming polls while others lauded the INDIA ally's ‚Äòresilience in the face of adversity‚Äô. 







    ‚ÄúYou can intimidate and put everyone in India in jail... You can also put me behind bars, but I will surely come out. The BJP is putting everyone in jail only to win the election,"" the TMC supremo told people during a public distribution programme in Nadia district.

The anti-tribal face of BJP is coming to the fore in Jharkhand‚Ä¶This is an insult to the public opinion of the state. That is why every resident will vote against BJP this time and it will have to face a historic defeat,"" said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.




   Meanwhile the Congress linked the matter to its ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra.

By resorting to such tactics, they seek to suppress opposition voices and undermine the cohesion within the INDIA bloc,"" Ramesh said.    The JMM leader was arrested on Wednesday night after a marathon seven hour interrogation by the Enforcement Directorate. He resigned as Chief Minister prior to his arrest, with party loyalist and state Transport Minister Champai Soren taking over the reins.    (With inputs from agencies)

Will Champai Soren become Jharkhand CM? A look at seat equation as delay sparks horse-trading fears,"Jharkhand spent almost a day without a chief minister after Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday. While Soren was sent to one-day judicial custody in connection with a ""land scam"" case, a political upheaval unfolded in the state's political arena. 







  Champai Soren, who is in line to become the next chief minister of Jharkhand, met Governor CP Radhakrishnan on Thursday evening. During the meeting, he demanded that ""the process to start the formation of the new government should begin"" soon. 




 ALSO READ: Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren accuses ED of being ‚Äòpolitically motivated‚Äô, having agenda to disrupt state govt        According to Champai Soran's statement, the Governor had assured him that the process would start soon. Champai Soren had earlier staked a claim to form the new government in Jharkhand with the support of 47 legislators.    However, as many as 43 MLAs of the ruling JMM-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) alliance reached Rachi airport hours after their meeting with the Governor. This came after members of the JMM-led alliance said they would fly to Hyderabad in case of a delay in government formation.  ALSO READ: Hemant Soren sent to one-day judicial custody in money laundering case: 10 points    Despite this, JMM-led coalition MLAs in Jharkhand were unable to fly to Hyderabad due to unfavourable weather conditions leading to the cancellation of all flights from Ranchi‚Äôs Birsa Munda Airport. According to the Hindustan, all the MLAs returned to the state guest house as their flight from Ranchi was rescheduled owing to weather conditions.  But, why were MLAs being flown to Hyderabad?Jharkhand MLAs flying off to Hyderabad heralded the beginning of ""resort politics"". Since the Governor hasn't given time to Champai Soran to take oath yet, the alliance leaders expressed concerns over the delay in forming the new government in the state.    The ruling alliance's MLAs actively took steps to ""thwart any attempt of the opposition BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) to poach them"". Notably, the Congress is in power in Telangana.    ""We are unaware of the reasons for the delay...In case the Raj Bhawan delays in extending an invitation to the alliance to form a government, lawmakers will fly to Hyderabad, in a bid to thwart any attempt of the opposition BJP to poach them,"" state Congress chief Rajesh Thakur told PTI.  ALSO READ: 'It's a break': Hemant Soren's first reaction after ED arrest in money laundering case    Later, on his way to the airport on Thursday, Thakur said, ‚ÄúWe are going to the airport. You know what kind of people they are, they can do anything anytime.""¬†    Meanwhile, Congress in-charge for Jharkhand Ghulam Ahmad Mir was quoted by the Hindustan Times as saying, ‚ÄúMany MLAs can be soft targets. We wouldn't have needed to do this if the governor had sworn in the new chief minister...""    Amid the political turmoil, JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said the details about the oath-taking ceremony will be revealed on Friday. Meanwhile, Aajtak reported that a meeting of the BJP Legislative Party has also been called in Jharkhand at 1:30 pm on Friday.  ALSO READ: ‚ÄòKejriwal is next‚Äô: BJP MP warns after Jharkhand ex-CM Hemant Soren's ED arrest in land fraud case  43, 47 or 48? How many MLAs support JMM-Congress-RJDWhile some leaders of the JMM-Congress-RJD claimed the support of 47 MLAs, Rajesh Thakur said a total of 43 MLAs will go to Hyderabad ‚Äî showcasing the support Champai Soran has in the formation of the new government.    Champai Soren had earlier claimed he was waiting for an invite from the Raj Bhavan to form the government as he has the support of 47 MLAs in the 81-member assembly. He said a letter of support signed by 43 MLAs had already been submitted.    Meanwhile, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge tweeted on X, saying that despite having the support of 48 MLAs, not inviting Champai Soren to form the government is clearly contempt of the Constitution and denial of public mandate.    The state Congress chief said 43 MLAs were flying to Hyderabad, but ""three-four MLAs will stay in Ranchi to keep a watch here."" This makes a total of 46-47 MLAs.    Earlier in the day, the JMM-led alliance released a video showing the support of 43 MLAs in Jharkhand amid the political crisis. It is yet to be seen how many MLAs actually support Champai Soren and the ruling alliance.    ¬†




 How numbers stack up in Jharkhand AssemblyOf the total 81 assembly members, a party needs 41 to form a majority. As of now, the JMM, the Congress and the RJD alliance has at least 46 MLAs. According to the Jharkhand Assembly website, here's a political party-wise breakup in the fifth Jharkhand Assembly:  1. JMM has 29 MLAs  2. BJP has 25 MLAs  3. Congress has 16  4. Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Democratic) (JVMP) has two MLas  5. AJSU has 3 MLAs  6. RJD and NCP have one MLA each  7. There are two Independent MLAs

    Karpoori Thakur fought all his life for the rights and respect of the poor, Dalits, backward sections and the deprived, he said in the letter to Modi, expressing his gratitude for bestowing the country's highest civilian honour on the former Bihar chief minister in his birth centenary year. 




   The award was long-awaited and the government announced it in the first month of the year, the Rajya Sabha member noted.        Socialists and followers of Mahatma Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia draw inspiration from Karpoori Thakur's life, and the government's decision has ensured that he will be remembered as a Bharat Ratna, he said.

‚ÄòMaratha quota agitation to continue at least till‚Ä¶‚Äô: Manoj Jarange's fresh warning to Maharashtra government,"A day after calling off the protests and praising Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange said that the agitation will continue till the members of the community start receiving the benefits of reservation. The development came as several Maratha quota activists criticized Manoj Jarange and accused him of going easy on the government, who just handed him the draft proposal. 







    Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Friday that the Marathas will get the benefit of OBC reservation in the state and the government will soon issue Kunbi certificates to all the applicants. Manoj Jarange, who was leading huge protests in Maharashtra welcomed the announcement and decided to call off the indefinite hunger strike for Maratha quotas. 




   ""Our agitation will continue until at least one person from my community benefits under the new rules the state is going to introduce. The state government has shown me the draft, and the final notification is yet to be out. We are closely watching the developments,"" Manoj Jarange said while speaking with the reporters in the Jalna district of Maharashtra.        The Maratha leader said that he would go to Raigad fort on Monday and pay his tribute to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. ""I will go home (in Jalna district) only after paying tributes,"" he said.  The contentious Maratha quotaThe Shiv Sena-BJP government in Maharashtra is walking a tightrope as Manoj Jarange's hunger strike is gathering a lot of momentum in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Marathas constitute 32% of the population in the state and wield a considerable influence in the politics of Maharashtra.    The task of granting the Maratha reservation is a daunting one as giving it ‚Äòout of the scope‚Äô of existing OBC reservations can bring the ire of the judiciary, like in the past, and putting it ‚Äòinside the scope‚Äô of existing OBC reservations puts government on the backfoot with other communities.

"Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration: ‚ÄòWill maintain neutrality from religion...treat all equally‚Äô, says Ravi Shankar Prasad","Ravi Shankar Prasad has asserted that India 'will maintain neutrality from religion and the State will treat all religions equally,' amid the preparations for the consecration ceremony of Ayodhya's Lord Ram temple. 







  Ram Mandir Inauguration LIVE 




   In an interview with The Indian Express, the BJP leader added, ""India is a deeply religious country, and respect for all faiths is integral to Indian ethos. Rig Veda says ‚ÄòEkam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti‚Äô, meaning truth is one but interpreted differently. You have your perceptions, you respect my path, and I will respect yours. The ultimate truth is permanent, eternal, and omnipresent. That is the real core"".        He said India would never become a theocratic nation.  Ayodhya Ram Mandir: A look at the preparations for the consecration ceremony    Several videos and footage have emerged from BJP-ruled states where people are seen celebrating the consecration of Ram Temple with furore.    Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has gone on an 11-day fast and is visiting temples across the country before the 22 January ceremony.  Ayodhya Ram Mandir: Date, aarti timings, darshan, and other details here    The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) senior leaders, karyakartas and supporters have explicitly expressed their joy for the grand ceremony. However, the opposition has targeted the Central government saying that the line between the State and religion has blurred, and accused BJP of playing politics in the name of Lord Ram in a bid to win the 2024 Lok Sabha election.  Pran Pratishtha: Ram Mandir gets world‚Äôs most expensive Ramayana    However, Prasad told the English Daily that 'Felicitating the grand ceremony, arranging for that does not mean blurring the lines. So many people are coming and the machinery is just facilitating them. Should religious places in India be filled with dirt? Why cannot our religious places become extraordinary, like the Vatican? Ayodhya is sacred to the Hindus. The priests are there, (but) after all Modi, our Prime Minister, is a Ram bhakt"".    Opposing the views of India's first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, Prasad said that Modi, "" is going there as a real worshipper of Lord Ram, and he is following the required discipline for it"".    Notably, Prasad was a lawyer in the Patna High Court when (L K) Advaniji was arrested during Rath Yatra in Bihar. Advani's 90s Rath Yatra provided a movement to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in Indian political history.  Ram Mandir event: Gujarat traders to give 'one-day salary' as bonus to employees    Prasad told The Indian Express that Advani never wanted bail but permission to go to New Delhi to vote for the no-confidence motion against the V P Singh government.    ""Lalu Prasad (the then Bihar CM) became a champion by arresting him, Mulayam Singh Yadav became the champion of secular politics by firing upon kar sevaks...And we started rising in the political landscape,"" he said.    Prasad said the Ram Temple is being erected with a Supreme Court order.  Ram Mandir ceremony: First look of Ram Lalla's idol revealed | In Pictures    ""There is ample evidence on record that, in spite of the erection of the so-called disputed structure, the faith of the Hindus never wavered on the place of birth of Lord Ram. They would go and bow their heads in front of it, for which there are accounts of travellers and Christian missionaries. Archeological Survey of India (ASI) findings also clearly established that on the ruins of a very old temple of the 8th-9th Century, the Babri mosque was erected. That many of the artefacts of the temple had been used in it,"" Prasad added.  Ayodhya Ram Mandir: These states declared a holiday or half day on January 22    The Ram Temple consecration ceremony is being held after the first phase of the temple‚Äôs construction, made possible by a historic Supreme Court judgment in 2019 on the temple-mosque dispute. The Hindu litigants argued that the Babri Mosque was constructed at the site of a temple marking the birthplace of Lord Ram.    In 1992, the 16th-century mosque was demolished by ‚Äòkar sevaks‚Äô.

"'Tejashwi Yadav, dard ho rha hai...?' AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi takes a dig as Nitish Kumar returns to NDA","""Tejaswi Yadav, how does it feel?"" All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said on Sunday as he took a dig at the Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Owaisi's statement came after JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar severed ties with the Lalu Yadav's party and returned to the BJP-led NDA. 







    Speaking with ANI on Sunday, Owaisi said the RJD fell victim to the same ""game"" it had played with the AIMIM in 2022. He was referring to the alliance between the RJD and JD(U) which was formed in 2022. 




 Follow Bihar politics LIVE Updates here        ""I want to ask Tejashwi Yadav how does it feel? Dard ho rha hai seene me? Takleef ho rhi hai aapko apne bheje me? (Is it aching you in your heart and bothering you now?) He took away four of our MLAs. Does he feel the same pain now? He has been played the same way he played us...,"" Owaisi said.




   ¬†    Owaisi's party had won five seats in the 2020 Bihar Assembly Elections. In June 2022, four of the five MLAs joined the ruling the RJD.    The AIMIM chief said Tejashwi Yadav and his family sidelined the people of Bihar and their focus is to only have someone from among them to be the chief minister. ""Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar wants to be the CM for as long as he lives. The BJP just wants to get everything, by hook or by crook...,"" Owaisi said.    Owaisi said Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi Yadav and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should apologise to the nation for betraying the people of Bihar.    Nitish Kumar resigned as the Bihar chief minister on Sunday, confirming rumours of his exit from the ruling Mahagathbandhan and the INDIA bloc.    Kumar had joined the 'Mahagathbandhan' in August 2022, when he had snapped ties with the BJP, accusing it of trying to ""split"" his Janata Dal (United). He had formed a new government with a multi-party coalition that included the RJD, the Congress and three Left parties.    After severing ties with the BJP in 2022, Kumar had then embarked on a drive to bring together all parties across the country to take on the BJP and that culminated in the formation of Opposition bloc INDIA.    But now, Kumar said on Sunday he had to sever ties with the RJD as ""not everything was alright"".

Maharashtra govt‚Äôs decision to give OBC benefits to Marathas could lead to unrest in state: Union minister Narayan Rane,"Reacting to the Maharashtra government's decision to give all benefits enjoyed by the OBCs (other backward communities) to Marathas till they get reservation, Union minister Narayan Rane on Sunday said it could lead to an unrest in the state. 







    In a post on X, Rane said that he does not approve of the state government's decision and assurance to the Maratha community regarding the reservation.¬† 




   ‚ÄúIt will lead to suppression of the Maratha community that has a historical legacy and it will also be an encroachment on the other backward communities"" Rane said. ‚ÄúIt could lead to an unrest in the state,"" he said, adding that he will speak on the issue on Monday also.      ALSO READ: Ajit Pawar's NCP slams ally CM Eknath Shinde's 'eyewash' response to Maratha quota demand    Activist Manoj Jarange on Saturday called off his indefinite fast for Maratha quota after the Maharashtra government accepted his demands, with chief minister Eknath Shinde announcing that till Marathas get reservation, they will be given all the benefits enjoyed by the OBCs.    A draft notification was issued by the government following negotiations with Jarange, stating that blood relatives of a Maratha person, who has records to show that he belongs to the agrarian Kunbi community, would also be recognised as Kunbi.    Kunbi, an agrarian community, falls in the OBC category, and Jarange, who is spearheading the agitation for reservation for the Marathas since last August, has been demanding Kunbi certificates for all Marathas.    Maharashtra cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal has also expressed dissatisfaction over his government's decision and questioned the ‚Äúbackdoor entry"" of Marathas into the OBC category.¬†    Bhujbal also claimed that Justice (retd) Sandeep Shinde, who heads a committee set up to find Kunbi records of Marathas, was getting almost double the salary drawn by the Chief Justice of India and called it an unnecessary expenditure.    Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has tried to assuage concerns of the OBCs, stating that Marathas would not get Kunbi caste certificate without any proof.    ¬†  (With inputs from agencies)

‚ÄòCan't have one-size-fits-all‚Ä¶‚Äô: Shashi Tharoor as INDIA bloc allies announce solo fights for 2024 Lok Sabha Polls,"Congress MP from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor has remarked that every party in the INDIA bloc ‚Äúis going to have a one-size-fits-all solution"", as the opposition alliance faces spilt threats from several states. 







    The Opposition INDIA bloc is plagued by rift reports arising from Trinamool Congress (TMC)'s Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab and Haryana, and now Janata Dal (United)'s Nitish Kumar in Bihar.¬† 




   As Rahul Gandhi leads the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Manipur, and the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections near, the INDIA bloc seems to be facing extreme distress in keeping all allies together.      Shashi Tharoor commented on the ongoing rift between the INDIA bloc allies and said, ‚ÄúThis whole alliance & seat-sharing is being discussed on a state-by-state basis. No one is going to have a one-size-fits-all solution. In each state, the story is going to be different"".    ""I think we are all focused on the imperative need to change the Union govt & that is the ultimate objective...Opposition is planning to attend the Parliament session..."" Shashi Tharoor added.




   Power politics in Bihar intensified amid strong indications that Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar may do yet another volte-face and return to the BJP-led NDA.¬†    BJP sources declined to comment on whether a decision has been taken to join hands with the JD(U). Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda have been holding meetings over the developments in Bihar.    Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had joined hands with RJD, founded by his former arch-rival Lalu Prasad, in August 2022 after he severed ties with the BJP which he accused of having tried to engineer a split in the JD(U).    The longest-serving CM of Bihar, thereafter, embarked upon a drive to bring together all parties, across the country, to take on the BJP that culminated in the formation of the opposition bloc INDIA.    The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced to go solo in Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls. Earlier, the party announced that it would contest all Lok Sabha seats in Punjab alone.  TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee has already announced that her party will fight the Lok Sabha elections ""alone"" in West Bengal. In case Nitish Kumar decides to return to the NDA fold, the opposition united front will also take a big hit.

"JDU leader KC Tyagi says Nitish Kumar 'insulted', RJD's Tejashwi responds 'Bihar mein khel hona baki hai'","Janata Dal (United)'s political adviser and spokesperson KC Tyagi said on Saturday it all but clear that the grand alliance government in Bihar is on the verge of collapse. He even accused a section of the Congress leadership of repeatedly ""insulting"" Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. 







    The statement came as speculation are rife that Nitish Kumar may switch alliances and return to the BJP-led NDA ahead of the Lok Sabha Election 2024. 




 Follow Bihar politics LIVE Updates here""The INDIA bloc is on the verge of collapse. The alliance of INDIA bloc parties is almost over in Punjab, West Bengal and Bihar,"" Tyagi was quoted by ANI as saying.        ""The goal and intentions with which Kumar, the JD(U) president, succeeded in bringing non-Congress parties with the Congress have come unstuck,"" Tyagi said, asserting that their leader was ""misunderstood"".  ALSO READ: Amid Nitish Kumar 'ghar wapasi' reports, Akhilesh Yadav says alliance with Congress off to good start with‚Ä¶    ""Kumar never hankered after a position in the alliance but a section of the Congress leadership repeatedly insulted him,"" he said. Tyagi reportedly said he could not see as to how the INDIA bloc parties could fight the ""all-powerful"" BJP.    However, at the press conference on Saturday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh highlighted the importance Nitish Kumar has in the INDIA bloc. He said one of the architects of the alliance is the Bihar Chief Minister and one of the co-architects is the West Bengal Chief Minister (Mamata Banerjee).  'Bihar mein abhi khel hona baki hai'Leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) gathered at party supremo Lalu Prasad's home in Patna on Saturday to attend an emergency meeting convened by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav.    As per ANI, sources informed that Tejashwi Yadav told the leaders of the party present at the meeting that the Nitish Kumar is ""respectable"" but there were many factors which were not under his ""control.""  ALSO READ: 'Mallikarjun Kharge tried to speak with Nitish Kumar, but...': Congress says situation could be better    ""CM Nitish Kumar was and is respectable. Many things are not under his (Nitish Kumar) control. RJD's allies in the 'Mahagathbandhan' always respected the Chief Minister..."" Tejashwi Yadav was quoted as saying by the sources.    The sources added that Tejashwi had also hinted at many unexpected developments in the state. ""The Chief Minister used to sit with me on the stage and ask, ""What was there in Bihar before 2005?"" I never reacted... Now, more people are with us,"" Yadav reportedly said,    ""Whatever remained undone in two decades, we managed to get it done within a short time- be it jobs, caste census, increasing reservation, etc. 'Bihar mein abhi khel hona baki hain' (The game is yet to begin in Bihar) Yadav was quoted as saying.    Some time ago, former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had taken a swipe at the ruling alliance in Bihar following Nitish Kumar's meeting with the governor.

BJP takes ‚Äòmental bankruptcy‚Äô jibe at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on AAP MLA poaching charge: ‚ÄòGive proof or resign‚Äô,"Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday hit back at Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal for alleging that BJP had offered seven AAP MLAs  ‚Çπ25 crore, and a ticket to contest polls to switch sides. BJP rejected the claims as 'false"" and ‚Äúbaseless"". The saffron party also asked CM Kejriwal to provide evidence of his claim.¬† 







    AAP leaders, including convener Arvind Kejriwal, alleged that seven MLAs of the party were offered  ‚Çπ25 crore each and a BJP ticket to contest polls if they switched sides. 




   Following the allegations, Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva said that Kejriwal should stop ""lying"" and dared him to tell the names of the MLAs who, the AAP chief has claimed, were contacted by the BJP.        ""Kejriwal's statement shows his political frustration. He said that the BJP wants to break off his party MLAs. This shows his mental bankruptcy and how much a party of 62 MLAs (out of 70 in Assembly) is frustrated after losing its political ground,"" he said.    Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that Chief Minister Kejriwal has made ""false allegations to defame the BJP"".    ""He should provide proof of his statement otherwise he should resign from the post of chief minister,"" Bidhuri said, adding that the BJP is consulting experts for legal action in this matter.    He also claimed that Arvind Kejriwal's dream of becoming a major political leader in the country was disintegrating as the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was soaring after the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.    ""The BJP is going to win 400 seats in Lok Sabha polls, so AAP is falsely accusing the BJP of poaching its MLAs,"" he said.    The AAP leaders have also alleged that the BJP was conspiring to get Kejriwal arrested in a ""fake"" liquor scam case and topple his government by poaching AAP MLAs.    Sachdeva said, ""People can see that Kejriwal needs an alliance for survival as his political ground has slipped ahead of Lok Sabha polls. So, he is making such absurd statements so that he can stay alive politically.""    Delhi BJP secretary Bansuri Swaraj called the claims ‚Äúabsurd"" and said CM Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders including Delhi minister Atishi have lost all their discretion before their imminent fall.    ""Kejriwal has now run out of excuses to avoid ED investigation in the liquor scam so he has started resorting to lies,"" she charged.    Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has so far skipped four notices of the Enforcement Directorate for questioning in connection with a money laundering case linked to an alleged excise policy scam in his government.

Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra set to resume today from West Bengal after two-day pause,"After a two-day hiatus, the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra led by Rahul Gandhi is set to recommence from Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal on Sunday. 







    The journey, which started in Manipur on January 14, crossed into West Bengal from Assam on Thursday morning. During the break, Rahul Gandhi returned to New Delhi, PTI reported. 




   ‚ÄúGandhi will arrive at the Bagdogra airport in Siliguri at 11.30 am. Subsequently, he will proceed to Jalpaiguri, from where the Yatra will recommence,"" state Congress leader Suvankar Sarkar said.        Also Read: Will soon identify Rahul Gandhi's 'body double' used during Nyay Yatra in Assam, just wait‚Ä¶: Himanta Biswa Sarma    He further added, ‚ÄúThe Yatra, which will proceed both by bus and on foot, will halt for the night near Siliguri.""    On Monday, it will head to Islampur in Uttar Dinajpur district, before entering Bihar, he added.    The Yatra is set to re-enter West Bengal on January 31 through Malda, and after passing through Murshidabad, it is scheduled to exit the state on February 1. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has penned a letter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, requesting her assistance in ensuring the smooth execution of the program in the state.    Earlier, Congress raised concerns, alleging that some banners featuring Gandhi were damaged in Jalpaiguri.    Also Read: ‚ÄòSirf ek vyakti mandir mein ja sakta hai': Rahul Gandhi denied entry into Assam local temple    Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the State Congress president, expressed concern about encountering difficulties in obtaining permissions for hosting public meetings as part of the Yatra in West Bengal. A day before the Yatra entered into the state, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declared that her party, the TMC, would independently participate in the Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, separate from the opposition bloc INDIA.    The Yatra is planned to cover a distance of 6,713 kilometres during a 67-day journey, passing through 110 districts across 15 states. It is set to conclude in Mumbai on either March 20 or 21.

"'Mallikarjun Kharge tried to speak with Nitish Kumar, but...': Congress says situation could be better","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the party is hopeful that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee will continue to be part of the INDIA bloc. He said the ""situation could be better"" as that it is not a good sign for the image of INDIA alliance. 







    Amid several reports suggesting Nitish Kumar's alliance with the BJP in Bihar, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the party chief Mallikarjun Kharge is ‚Äútrying to speak with the Bihar chief minister"". Ramesh said Kharge made several attempts to speak with Nitish Kumar, but as both of them are very busy, no conversation could be held between them.¬† 




 Follow Bihar politics LIVE Updates here        ‚ÄúThere will be a time‚Ä¶they have called back but no conversation could be held between them so far‚Ä¶this happens sometimes,"" ¬†Ramesh said. ¬†He added that former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has been given the task to handle the situation in Bihar.    Meanwhile, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge was quoted by ANI as saying that he will speak only after getting proper information and ""those interested in saving democracy will not change their minds and will stay with us"". Kharge said he would have full information when he reaches Delhi.    ""I wrote a letter and tried to talk with them... What they have in mind is not clear. I am travelling to Dehradun tomorrow, then move to Delhi. I will get full information. Otherwise, it creates confusion. Let us see what will happen. We don't know...if they are approaching Governor,"" Kharge told reporters in Karnataka's Kalaburagi.    At the press conference on Saturday, Jairam Ramesh also highlighted the importance Nitish Kumar has in the INDIA bloc. He said one of the architects of the alliance is the Bihar Chief Minister and one of the co-architects is the West Bengal Chief Minister.    Ramesh said, ""On June 23 (2023), Nitish Kumar had invited 18 political parties and the first meet of opposition parties was held in Patna and the Bihar Chief Minister had hosted it. The second meeting was held in Bengaluru on July 17-18. The alliance was named ‚ÄòINDIA‚Äô...In that meeting too, Nitish Kumar played an important role. The third meeting was held on August 31 and September 1 in Mumbai. In that meeting also...Nitish Kumar's contribution was important.""    The statement by Congress leaders came as uncertainty looms over the JD(U)-RJD alliance in Bihar. Several reports claimed that Nitish Kumar may ditch the INDIA alliance and return to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However, there has been no official confirmation on these claims. Meanwhile, RJD and Congress leaders have sought clarification on the same, asking Kumar to ""clear the confusion"" on the matter.  On TMC going solo in Lok Sabha Elections¬†Jairam Ramesh also commented on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declaration that her party, the TMC, will go solo in the state for the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections. The Congress said Banerjee ‚Äúexpressed some reservation‚Ä¶ she ended up saying that she will fight the BJP uncompromisingly"". He said, ‚ÄúThis gives us hope for the middle-path"".    ""Her (Mamata Banerjee) target is defeating the BJP...she wants to beat the BJP and this is also the target of the Congress and the INDIA alliance. Therefore, this is not a matter of controversy,"" Jairam Ramesh said while invited the West Bengal CM to participate in the Bharat Jodo Yatra. ¬†    He said Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi respect Mamata Banerjee and know that the TMC and Mamata Banerjee's presence will be important to beat the BJP.    He added the INDIA bloc is not ‚Äúimploding but showing our democratic credentials"", adding that the ‚Äúoptics could have been better"".

Is Nitish Kumar returning to NDA? A guide to what's happening in Bihar politics,"Will JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar flip again before the 2024 Lok Sabha election? Several reports were doing the rounds on Thursday, claiming that the Bihar chief minister may soon snap his ties with Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). JD(U), RJD and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders reportedly held separate meetings on Thursday evening. 







    Nitish Kumar, Bihar's longest-serving chief minister, has reportedly been upset with the INDIA bloc for not getting a position in the alliance commensurate with his stature. Kumar also favours an early assembly poll to go with the Lok Sabha elections. This suggestion has not drawn a positive response from the RJD, the biggest party in the state's ruling alliance, sources told news agency PTI. 




   Meanwhile, sources told India Today that RJD supremo Lalu Yadav spoke to Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary. ""Even the Deputy Speaker Maheswar Hazari has cancelled his out-of-state tour in view of changing dynamics in Bihar political circles,"" the report said.¬†        As of now, the Mahagathbandhan comprising the JD(U) and the RJD are in power in Bihar.  Here's everything you need to know about what is happening in Bihar's political arena.  1. JDU-RJD to snap ties? What rumours sayRumour has it that Nitish Kumar's JD(U) may return to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after snapping ties with the RJD. Nitish Kumar is a key ally of the Opposition's INDIA bloc.    Speculations were rife after RJD president Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at Kumar for ""changing his ideology as the wind changes its direction"" in posts on 'X'. Before this, Nitish Kumar had taken potshots at political parties promoting family members in politics.  Jan Ki Baat, which predicts elections through opinion and exit polls, cited sources as saying that Nitish Kumar is set to return to the NDA and is currently mulling legal options to dissolve the state assembly.    Meanwhile, India Today reported that the BJP has set a condition for the JD(U) chief ‚Äî that if he wants to return to the alliance, then Nitish Kumar must give up the chief minister's post.  Zee News cited sources as saying that the BJP can bring Nitish Kumar to the Centre.    Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan was also reportedly in touch with the BJP leadership. ""I believe the next 24 hours are crucial,"" Chirag Paswan reportedly said.  2. Key MeetingsA series of meetings were reportedly held in Patna on Thursday evening. According to a Times Now report, JDU leaders held a meeting at Nitish Kumar's house, while RJD leaders held a separate meeting at Lalu Yadav's house.




   Meanwhile, Bihar BJP president Samrat Chaudhary and former deputy chief minister Sushil Modi are likely to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other senior party leaders on Thursday evening, sources said. ""Amit Shah is likely to meet Bihar BJP chief Samrat Chaudhary and Sushil Modi,"" a source told PTI.    Chirag Pawan has also called a meeting of LJP leaders at his residence later Thursday night, India Today reported.  3. What JDU leaders have said?Speaking with media on Thursday, JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said, ""INDIA gathbandhan (alliance) salamat hai...Everything is fine in the alliance...""    When asked about Nitish Kumar's statement on dynastic politics and Rohini Acharya's tweet, Tyagi said, ‚ÄúBaccho ke comments par hum comment nahi karte (We don't comment on a child's remarks). Nitish Kumar's comment was neither on Lalu Yadav nor Sonia Gandhi, he was appreciating Karpoori Thakur...""    Tyagi also said there were no problems with regard to the sharing of seats between JD(U) and RJD. ""However, there seem to be certain issues between the RJD and its older allies like the Congress and three Left parties. These must be sorted out at the earliest since we seem to be lagging behind the NDA in terms of poll preparedness,"" he was quoted by PTI as saying.    He also made it clear that the JD(U), which had in 2019 contested 17 seats, winning all but one of these, would not compromise on its own share.    On the latest meetings, another JD(U) leader G M Shaheen was quoted by Times Now as saying, ‚Äú...these are just routine meetings that are going on in the state of Bihar.""  4. What BJP leaders have saidUnion Minister Giriraj Singh said, ‚ÄúAs a BJP worker, I can say that the door to enter into our party is closed for Nitish Kumar. He is an unreliable politician.""    Meanwhile, in an interview with News 18, former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said it is in the hands of the central leadership to make a decision on the alliances.  5: What fuelled these speculationsSign 1: JD(U) and RJD leaders have been sniping at each other amid speculations among Kumar's supporters that their ally has been trying to undermine him in matters of governance as well as politics.    According to PTI, Kumar's decision to take over as the JD(U) president, by cutting short the tenure of Lalan Singh, was seen as a determined effort by him to take firm control of its organisation. This was amid suggestions from a section of JD(U) leaders that the chief minister's confidant may have grown too close to the RJD or was pursuing an independent agenda.  Sign 2: Nitish Kumar had earlier rejected the post of convenor of the INDIA bloc. JD(U) national general secretary Sanjay Kumar Jha had then said it would be deliberated upon within the party even as he claimed that the Bihar CM was in favour of a Congress leader becoming the chairperson.  Sign 3: Nitish Kumar may not join Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra when it reaches the state on January 29, sources told NDTV.  Sign 4: The BJP has been showing signs of warming up to Kumar, with its leaders toning down their criticism of him of late and even praising him at times. Asked about the likelihood of the Janata Dal (U) president's return to the BJP-led alliance, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said the party will consider if such a proposal is ever made. Earlier, Shah had often asserted that the doors had been closed for Kumar's return to the country's ruling alliance, PTI reported.  Sign 5: While addressing an event recently, Nitish Kumar had criticised the dynasty politics ‚Äî usually associated with the RJD, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP). He had said, ""These days, many people are more focussed on promoting their own family in politics, but Karpoori-ji never did that in his lifetime.""    However, KC Tyagi asserted that Nitish Kumar's remarks about dynasty politics were not aimed at ally RJD. Tyagi, who is the JD(U)'s political advisor, said Kumar's expression of gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for conferring Bharat Ratna on Karpoori Thakur, did not amount to a ""prashansa"" (praise).    ""Nitish Kumar had appreciated the fulfillment of a long-standing demand and not showered praise on the PM. As regards the views on dynasty politics, different people sometimes happen to share a similar opinion on a matter.

"Karnataka news: Ex-CM Jagadish Shettar returns to BJP, 9 months after switching to Congress","Karnataka's former chief minister Jagadish Shettar rejoined the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on January 25, nine months after switching to the Congress. The 68-year-old Shettar, a staunch RSS man and a senior BJP leader, switched to the Congress after he was denied a ticket during the 2023 assembly election. 







    Lingayat leader Jagadish Shettar has contested the 2023 Karnataka Assembly Elections as a Congress candidate from Hubli-Dharwad-Central. Shettar suffered defeat. He was beaten by the BJP's Mahesh Tenginakai by over 34,000 votes, after which he blamed ""money power and pressure tactics"". 




   On Thursday afternoon, he reached the BJP headquarters where he was welcomed back to the party in the presence of former CM BS Yediyurappa and state BJP President BY Vijayendra.        ""Today, it is good news for us that Jagadish Shettar has again joined the BJP leaving Congress MLC post. We welcome him to the party,"" said Union minister Bhupendra Yadav.




   ‚ÄúThe party gave me a lot of responsibilities in the past. Because of some issues, I went to the Congress party. In the last 8-9 months, there were a lot of discussions in the BJP. Karnataka BJP leaders and workers asked me to come back to the BJP. Yediyurappa ji and Vijayendra ji also wanted me to come back to the BJP. I am rejoining the party with the belief that Narendra Modi ji has to become the PM again,"" Jagadish Shettar said as he rejoined.    Jagadish Shettar met party president JP Nadda in Delhi.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/karnataka-news-jagadish-shettar-returns-to-bjp-a-year-after-switching-to-congress-11706169237738.html,84,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.072,0.029,0.899,0.9925
"Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma takes ‚Äòsoft naxalite‚Äô jibe at Rahul Gandhi: ‚ÄòI too was in Congress for 22 years, but‚Ä¶‚Äô","Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra entered West Bengal's Cooch Behar on Thursday. The Nyay Yatra faced tension while the Congress leaders were in Assam, wherein FIR was filed against Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, and Kanhaiya Kumar. Barbs flew between Assam Chief Minister and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Himanta Biswa Sarma and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. 







    Continuing the political mudslinging, on Thursday, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma alleged that Congress politics have become ‚Äúsoft naxalite"". On Wednesday the Assam CM had accused Rahul Gandhi of provoking the crowd with his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and ‚ÄúNaxalite tactics"". 




   Reminiscing about the time when Himanta Biswa Sarma was part of Congress, the Assam CM said, ‚ÄúTheir slogans don't reflect Gandhian principles anymore. I too was in Congress for 22 years. But it never had such slogans earlier.""        ""Congress had a soft slogan. I see that they have killed even the soul of Congress. Entire carcade was full of so-called Left people, Left-leaning people."", Assam CM said.




   As Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)'s 2024 Lok Sabha Poll campaign in Bulandshar on Thursday, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ‚ÄúBJP will win all constituencies covered by Rahul Gandhi during Nyay Yatra in Assam"".¬†    ‚ÄúRahul Gandhi's Nyay Yatra in Assam during Ram temple consecration a political conspiracy to create communal tension"", Himanta Biswa Sarma alleged.    Launching fresh attacks on Wayanad MP and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that Rahul wanted to destabilise Assam during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.    Himanta Biswa Sarma also said that they would arrest Rahul Gandhi after the Lok Sabha elections.    ""We will arrest him after the Lok Sabha election. If we arrest him before, it will become politicised. Now the case has been registered, SIT will investigate, and we have evidence. A big incident could have happened in Guwahati after he instigated to break barricades. We don't want to do politics before the Lok Sabha election because we are going to win this election,"" he said.  Rahul Gandhi and Himanta Biswa Sarma have been locked in a verbal duel since the Yatra began in Assam on January 18.

Ram Mandir ceremony poses bigger challenge for opposition ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"The start of January's third week saw the nation engage in what Mikhail Bakhtin has described as ‚Äòcarnivalesque‚Äô. The Pran Pratistha ceremony of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya's half constructed Ram Mandir was paradigmatic of the Bakhtin described de-stabilization or reversal of power structures, as happens in traditional forms of carnival.¬† 







    However, the evident urgency of the consecration ceremony that could potentially seal a third term win for the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could also frame a bigger challenge for the opposition INDIA bloc now.¬† 




   The challenge to the opposition in India only magnified from the 2019 Supreme Court decision to 2020 Bhoomi Pujan by PM Narendra Modi to the 2024 Pran Pratistha ceremony.¬†        The 22 January ceremony could pave the way for a new chapter in national politics, when the Prime Minister of a constitutionally secular nation led India to celebrate Ram Lalla, while Muslims were beaten up in other parts of the country.¬†    The Pran Pratistha ceremony saw a calmer Rashtriya SwayamSevak Sangh (RSS), while Mohan Bhagwat was seated right next to PM Modi during the ceremony. ‚ÄúLord Ram has returned to Ayodhya after 500 years"": this remained the general fervor of the ceremony and of many who celebrated across the country.¬†    The ceremony remained a resplendent message that there would be an unprecedented Hindutva surge amid statements of reconciliation from Sangh Parivar leaders who were once seen to occupy the ‚Äúfringe"" of mainstream Indian politics.    22 January saw a state holiday in UP, and also a half day for Central government employees ‚Äì the state came across as having the kind of intimacy with religious rituals that it rarely had since independence.    Since Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, the Opposition INDIA bloc has only put forth a strong opposition to the Ram Mandir movement.¬†    In 1989, the BJP had said, in its Palampur resolution, that not the courts but a negotiated settlement or legislation could solve the issue, the Opposition parties had left the matter to the judiciary.    With the judiciary handing the land to the Hindu side in 2019, the opposition seemed to have been caught in a dilemma.¬†    From the Congress declining the invitation to attend the consecration to Samajwadi Party saying it would attend at a later date, from TMC‚Äôs inter-faith rally to AAP‚Äôs shobha yatras and community kitchens in the capital, each member of the Opposition is trying to figure its own way out.    The INDIA bloc, whose inability to maintain unity on regional fronts have now found themselves unable to agree on the Ayodhya Ram Mandir cause. Notably the BJP had hard lined their ideological stance around the Ram Mandir for over three decades, except when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in power.¬†    The consecration of the temple has been accompanied by a sense of resignation within the Muslim community with most of its leaders saying they want to move on.    Whether INDIA bloc can weather the Ram Mandir carnival with an even better devised artifice to counter the BJP master stroke will be one to see in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections.¬†    ¬†

"Rahul Gandhi to be arrested after Lok Sabha elections, says Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday that action will be taken against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, on the charges of instigating violence during his ‚ÄòBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra‚Äô and he will be arrested after the Lok Sabha elections 2024. The remarks came a day after the Assam police registered a suo motu FIR against Rahul Gandhi for ‚Äúwanton acts of violence"" in Guwahati during his nationwide Yatra. 







    ''We have filed an FIR. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) will conduct the investigation and he (Gandhi) will be arrested after the Lok Sabha elections,"" Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the sidelines of the event in the Sibsagar district of the state. 




   Himanta Biswa Sarma directed the Director General of Police G P Singh to register a case against Rahul Gandhi for provoking the crowds, who clashed with police as the Congress leader wanted to enter Guwahati city. In the scuffle with the police, several Congress workers were injured including the state party President Bhupen Bora, and the leader of the opposition in the state assembly.        Assam police said that four police personnel sustained injuries after Congress workers attempted to break barricades. They have charged Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi under criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting, assault, or criminal force to deter public servants from discharging their duty, damaging public property and others.    The DGP said that the case has been transferred to the state Crime Investigation Department (CID) for a thorough investigation and the special investigation team (SIT) headed by the Additional Director General of Police (CID) will conduct the probe into the matter.  ‚ÄòHimanta Biswa Sarma is the most corrupt CM‚Äô: Rahul GandhiRahul Gandhi resumed his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Assam's Barpeta on Wednesday and trained his guns on the Assam Chief Minister calling him ‚Äúthe most corrupt CM."" ""The Chief Minister of Assam (Himanta Biswa Sarma) spreads hate all the time and takes away your (referring to the public) lands. He is the most corrupt chief minister,"" the Congress leader said.    ‚ÄúWe are getting the publicity that we may not have got otherwise. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra has become a main issue in Assam. Preventing from visiting the temple and college‚Ä¶ it is their style. Intimidation tactics, we are not intimidated by them, we are not afraid of them,"" he added.  (With inputs from PTI)    ¬†

"'She is our didi, we respect her‚Äô: INDIA parties deny rift as Mamata Banerjee decides to fight LS polls alone in Bengal","After West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerje's announcement that her Trinamool Congress (TMC) party will fight Lok Sabha polls alone in the state, other parties in the INDIA bloc have been trying to alleviate the situation and hoping for a reunification of the TMC with the bloc. 







    Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said the statement was given in some particular situation and said that the INDIA parties will solve the conflict. 




   ""Please wait for some time. Maybe the statement was given in some particular situation. If there is a conflict then the alliance (INDIA) would solve it."" said Manoj Jha.        INDIA bloc alliance is facing internal disagreements over seat-sharing in different states. Another INDIA bloc member, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), is also locked in hectic negotiations with the Congress on seat sharing in Delhi and Punjab. The Arvind Kejriwal-led party believes that the TMC, the Congress and the alliance will resolve any differences.    ""The TMC is a big party in West Bengal, the Congress and the Left have always been fighting against them. So seat-sharing with the TMC will be a little difficult. The issues between them will be resolved. Mamata Banerjee and Rahul Gandhi are committed to the success of the INDIA bloc. We are hopeful that all parties in the INDIA bloc will fight elections together,"" said AAP leader and Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj.    Earlier on Wednesday, NCP working president Supriya Sule denied any internal rift in the alliance and said that all the member parties are in frequent conversation with each other.    ""She is our didi and we love and respect her. The alliance (INDIA) is united and we will all fight together. There will be no loss to the alliance. The model in every state will be different. There is no infight in the alliance. We are in frequent conversation,"" Sule told ANI on Wednesday.




   Amid speculations over the TMC's stance on Lok Sabha elections, Mamata Banerjee announced that the TMC would fight polls alone in Bengal.    ""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we alone will defeat the BJP. I gave many proposals but they rejected them from the beginning. From then, we have decided to fight the elections in Bengal alone"" the TMC supremo said.    She also claimed that the grand old party didn't inform her about the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra's schedule of passing through Bengal. Her remark is in contrast with the Congress' claim that it had invited all INDIA bloc parties to join the Yatra.    ¬†

"AAP, Congress seal alliance for Chandigarh mayoral polls on 18 January","The AAP and the Congress have arrived at an understanding on contesting the Chandigarh mayoral polls in an alliance, sources said on Monday. 







    Under the arrangement, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will fight for the mayor's seat while the Congress will contest the posts of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, the sources said. 




   The development came amid the AAP and the Congress, both constituents of the INDIA bloc, holding talks over seat sharing for this year's Lok Sabha polls.        With the AAP and the Congress deciding to have a tie-up for the January 18 Chandigarh mayoral polls, it is going to be a two-way contest and observers believe that the two parties will have an edge over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).    In the 35-member Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the BJP has 14 councillors. The party also has an ex-officio member MP who has voting rights.    The AAP has 13 councillors and the Congress seven. The Shiromani Akali Dal has one councillor in the House.    Polls for the posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor will be held on Thursday.    The Congress abstained from voting in 2022 and 2023, leading to the BJP's victory in the mayoral polls.    Elections for the three posts are held every year during the five-year term of the House. This year, the mayor's seat has been reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) category.

'Don't need Mamata's pity': INDIA bloc faces fresh hurdle amid Congress-TMC seat sharing row in West Bengal,"Cracks within the Opposition INDIA bloc widened this week with the Congress and Trinamool Congress sparring over seat-sharing in West Bengal. The development came after reports indicated that the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC had offered the other party two Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming polls. 







    ‚ÄúIt is Mamata who needs the Congress to win, not the other way around. We are quite capable of waging a solo fight in the state and winning more seats than we did last time. We are prepared to show as much. We don't need Mamata's pity and are quite capable of retaining these two seats (even if the TMC contests them)"" said Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. 




   The party's West Bengal chief scoffed at the reported allocation, noting that the seats in question were already held by Congress representatives. The TMC won 22 seats while the Congress won two (Behrampore and Malda South) Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections.¬†        ‚ÄúWe won these seats defeating Mamata Banerjee's TMC and the BJP. Are they doing us a favour? Who will trust her (Mamata) with seat allotment?"" he asked.  ALSO READ: TMC offers 2 Lok Sabha seats to Congress in Bengal for 2024 polls: ReportChowdhury also asserted that the Trinamool Congress was ‚Äúnot serious about strengthening or forging an alliance in Bengal"".¬†    ‚ÄúThe TMC is busy pleasing and serving Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protect themselves from the clutches of the CBI and the ED. The Congress is not going to beg before TMC for seats; we don't need their alms. Who are they to decide how many seats the party will contest? If needed, we will fight on our own; let the party high command take a call on it,"" he told reporters.    (With inputs from agencies)

‚ÄòLalan Singh wanted to change Bihar CM‚Ä¶‚Äô: BJP's big allegations against outgoing JD(U) chief,"A leadership change in Bihar's ruling Janata Dal United JD(U) raised the political heat in the state with BJP finding fresh ammunition to attack Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led Mahagathbandha alliance. Former Deputy CM of Bihar and BJP MP Sushil Modi alleged that JD(U) President Rajeev Ranjan Singh aka Lalan Singh was removed from his position as he was engineering defections in JD(U) with a plan to install Tejashwi Yadav as the next chief minister of Bihar. 







    The remarks come as Lalan Singh stepped down from his positions on Friday and Nitish Kumar took the reins of JD(U) at the national executive meeting of the party in New Delhi. 




   ‚ÄúWe had already announced earlier that Lalan Singh would be removed since he broke 12-13 MLAs off the JD(U) party and he had prepared to make Tejashwi Yadav CM by joining hands with Lalu Yadav but Nitish Kumar got to know it so he pre-empted it and removed Lalan Singh timely,"" Sushil Modi said.        The BJP MP also added that the removal of Lalan Singh is just the ‚Äúbeginning of the game."" ‚ÄúA lot of it is left,"" he remarked.    Sushil Modi said Nitish Kumar already had all the authority in the party and his recent move seems to be in the hope of a better position in the INDIA alliance. ‚ÄúNitish Kumar has a misunderstanding that the INDIA alliance will make him the convenor or party's face for PM...Our gates are closed for him,"" he added.  Parties should show big heart to make INDIA alliance successfulJD(U) chief spokesperson K C Tyagi affirmed that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar took charge of the party because of his wide acceptability among the people. The resolution adopted at the JD(U) meeting spoke in length about Nitish Kumar's leadership credentials and his ability to take everyone along.    ""The JD(U) believes that bigger parties in the alliance have more responsibilities... They will have to show a big heart to make this grand alliance successful. They will have to be generous if any leader has to be given the responsibility as per experience and capabilities,"" it said.    ¬†

Amit Shah targets Opposition in Rajya Sabha as SC upholds abrogation of Article 370 in J-K,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday moved the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2023, and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 in Rajya Sabha. During the discussion of the bill in the Upper House of Parliament, Union Home Minister Amit Shah mentioned the verdict of the Supreme Court upholding the abrogation of Article 370 and called it a big defeat of Opposition parties. 







  Article 370 verdict LIVE updates""Today, the decision (by Supreme Court on Article 370) has also come. Still, they (Congress) say that they don't accept this and that Article 370 was abrogated wrongfully. I can't explain to them what is the reality...Article 370 boosted separatism and separatism led to the rise of terrorism. One wrong decision can be taken but when history and time prove that the decision is wrong, one should come back towards the interest of the nation. I still say, come back otherwise there won't remain even how many are left now (MPs elected to the House). If you want to stick to this decision even today, public is watching - there will be face off in 2024 and PM Modi will become the PM for the third time,"" Union Amit Shah said while discussions in Rajya Sabha. 








       ""...Supreme Court also accepted that it is not right to challenge the announcements of Governor's rule and President's rule...When the temporary provision was made, the question arose that if it is temporary then how will it be removed? So a provision was inserted inside Article 373 that the President can amend Section 370, ban it and can also take it completely out of the Constitution..."" the minister added while speaking in Rajya Sabha.¬†    While speaking on the two bills related to Jammu and Kashmir, Amit Shah said that the Union Government has reserved 24 seats in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as the region is ours. ""...Earlier there were 37 seats in Jammu, now after the new delimitation commission, there are 43 seats. Earlier there were 46 in Kashmir, now there are 47 and in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, 24 seats have been reserved since we PoK is ours..."" the Union Home Minister said.  Bills on Jammu and KashmirThe Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 aims to amend the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019. The 2019 Act had previously made alterations to the Second Schedule of the 1950 Act, specifically outlining that the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly would consist of 83 seats. The current proposed Bill aims to augment the total number of seats to 90. Additionally, it introduces a provision for reserving seven seats for Scheduled Castes and nine seats for Scheduled Tribes. Furthermore, the Bill stipulates that the Lieutenant Governor is empowered to nominate up to two members from the Kashmiri migrant community to serve in the Legislative Assembly.  Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 offers preferential treatment in employment opportunities and enrollment in professional educational institutions for individuals belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other socio-educationally disadvantaged groups. The proposed Bill replaces the term ""weak and underprivileged classes"" with ""other backward classes"" as officially identified by the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.    Both the bills were passed unanimously in the Rajya Sabha as the Opposition parties staged a walk-out during the discussions.¬†    ¬†

"Sanjay Raut invokes Uddhav Thackeray‚Äôs name for INDIA bloc‚Äôs PM candidate, says he is a ‚Äònationalist face‚Äô","Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday, December 6 invoked the name of Uddhav Thackeray for the INDIA alliance‚Äôs prime ministerial candidate for the 2024 general elections, saying that Thackeray is a ‚Äúnationalist face"". 







    Replying to a reporter‚Äôs query about the PM face for the 2024¬† Lok Sabha elections, Raut said: ‚ÄúThere will be a discussion on this. There should indeed be a face."" 




   However, he refrained from directly putting Uddhav‚Äôs name in the race.        ‚ÄúUddhav Thackeray is a Hindutvawadi, nationalist face. A person who gets the approval of the INDIA alliance members can be the (PM) face. I don't want to say anything outside which might create any rift in the alliance,"" he added.    A meeting of the members of the INDIA alliance was scheduled to be held on Wednesday, but it was postponed as many constituents refused to attend the meeting, which was called by the Congress party.    The meeting had been postponed and could be organized on December 16 and 18, said Raut.    ‚ÄúThe INDIA alliance meeting was supposed to be held today but some prominent leaders were not available. There is a wedding in Mamata Banerjee's house, MK Stalin is busy with the relief operation in his flood-hit state, Nitish Kumar is not well, and Akhilesh Yadav is not available, therefore this meeting will be held on December 16 or 18. The face etc. everything will be decided in the meeting. We are together and you will see its result in 2024,"" he added.¬†    Many INDIA bloc allies, including TMC, National Conference, Samajwadi Party, JDU and RJD have blamed the Congress for its defeat in the recent assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.¬†    On Tuesday, Raut said that Shiv Sena UBT, Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress will contest the Lok Sabha election together.    ‚ÄúWe, the Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress are going to contest the election together (in Maharashtra). The BJP's strength has not increased. They want to make themselves capable by breaking down others. But people of Maharashtra think differently than people in other states,"" said Raut.

BJP winning elections in Gaumutra states: DMK MP's comments spark row; BJP says ‚Äòtake mental treatment‚Äô,"After the BJP's landslide victory in India's heartland states, several leaders have been calling out how the party's popularity is limited only to north India.

Congress's Bharat Jodo Yatra 2.0 in December? Sources say possibility can't be ruled out,"The possibility of the second phase of the Bharat Jodo Yatra in December cannot be ruled out, sources in the Congress told news agency ANI on Tuesday. The statement came amid reports hinting at the relaunch of the Bharat Jodo Yatra between December and February. 







    In September 2023, some of the Congress working committee (CWC) members had reportedly urged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to undertake another Bharat Jodo Yatra, this time from the east to west. The first one was from Kanyakumari (south) to Kashmir (north). 




   The Hindustan Times had reported that the second phase of the Bharat Jodo Yatra is expected to start from Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh and end at Porbandar in Gujarat, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.        ""Unlike the first march, this one may not be entirely on foot. Gandhi might use vehicles or boats to cover certain areas in the second phase,"" the report quoted the Congress saying in the past.    Several reports also suggested that the Bharat Jodo Yatra 2.0 might be in the hybrid mode. An India Today report said that this time, participants may be seen marching on foot as well as using vehicles.    The Congress's first Bharat Jodo Yatra became India‚Äôs longest foot march after it covered 75 districts in 126 days. The yatra had started from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu on September 7 last year. It covered a total distance of 4,080 km before ending in Srinagar in Kashmir on January 30.    Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had led the first phase of the yatra and the primary objective of this mass movement was to unite India against the Centre-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's divisive politics.    The report quoted a Congress leader as saying that the party made electoral gains in some states such as Karnataka after the first Bharat Jodo Yatra.. ‚ÄúIf the yatra takes place in January, it would be right before the Lok Sabha polls,"" the working committee member had said.

'BJP can't set foot here': AIADMK and BJP snapping ties in Tamil Nadu explained,"AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami had met Union Home Minister and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah in New Delhi, a few days ago, triggering speculations that the saffron party and the Dravidian party are considering a coalition for Tamil Nadu. However, on Monday, senior AIADMK leader D Jayaram announced that they are snapping ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party.¬† 







    This brought an end to an unending bickering between the AIADMK and the BJP that ensued in the previous few days. On Monday, D Jayaram said that AIADMK cannot tolerate any affront to the late Chief Minister Dravidian stalwart CN Annadurai, ¬†fondly addressed as Anna (elder brother), EV Ramasamy Periyar and late AIADMK veterans MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa. 




   Notably, the AIADMK and BJP relationship had come into question during the Sanatan Dharma remark row that began with DMK leader and Tamil Nadu Chief minister's son Udhayanidhi Stalin's remark.¬†      Annamalai's remarks on AIADMK leadersThe rift began with Tamil Nadu BJP leader Annamalai's comments on former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, and Annadurai.¬†  Comments on Jayalalithaa:¬†During an interview K Annamalai said had previously said, ‚Äúmany administrations of Tamil Nadu were corrupt with former chief ministers convicted in courts of law."" The former BJP allies in Tamil Nadu, and their saffron party's Dravidian connect for a bastion in the south had passed a condemnation resolution against Annamalai for his remark.¬†  Comments on Annadurai:Further on September 11, leading a demonstration against Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister P K Sekar Babu for his participation in the 'Sanatana Dharma' eradication conference here, Annamalai had made a comment on Annadurai.    Speaking to reporters in Coimbatore on Sunday, Annamalai asked if what he had said about Anna was wrong. He asserted that he is in politics to protect Sanatan Dharma and Tamil culture.    He insisted that he did not speak ill of Anna and had only mentioned an event from the pages of history and the manner in which Muthuramalinga Thevar had defended Sanatana Dharma.    To substantiate his claim, the BJP leader said, he had copies of news reports that appeared in the month of June in 1956 in a top national English daily.    The BJP leader said Anna had in the 1950s made a critical remark in Madurai against the Hindu faith at an event, and that it was staunchly opposed by freedom fighter Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar.  BJP's ambition of Tamil Nadu seatsWhile BJP leader Annamalai's remarks gave birth to seething tension between AIADMK and BJP, adding to an already strained relationship, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had told BJP workers in Tamil Nadu to target over 25 seats in the next general elections.  Why did AIADMK cut ties with BJP?¬†Senior AIADMK leader D Jayakumar, lashing out at Annamalai for his criticism of Annadurai, said his party workers will not tolerate any insult to the late CM.    While Annamalai had made critical remarks about AIADMK leaders including the late J Jayalalithaa in the past, the party had sought that the former be restrained.    ""Annamalai doesn't desire an alliance with AIADMK although BJP workers want it. Should we tolerate all this criticism of our leaders? Why should we carry you? BJP can't set foot here. Your votebank is known. You are known because of us,"" the former minister told reporters here while lashing out at the BJP and its state unit president.    ""We can't tolerate anymore (the criticism of leaders). As far as the alliance is concerned, it is not there. BJP is not with AIADMK. (the matter) can be decided only during the election. This is our stand,"" he said.    ""Our party has his (Annadurai) name. To promote himself, he belittles Periyar. He didn't budge even after condemnation. It is against coalition dharma; no AIADMK worker will accept this. Annamalai is unfit to be a leader and he is keen only about promoting him. What right have you got to talk about Periyar, EPS (Palaniswami), Amma (Jayalalithaa) and MGR. AIADMK workers will never accept this,"" Jayakumar added.    The AIADMK had nothing to lose over the alliance-related development. ""They are the losers,"" he said about the BJP. He repeatedly claimed the BJP and Annamalai will fare badly electorally without the AIADMK.  Will this affect the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections?¬†Trouble in paradise arises, when the saffron party, perprtartors and practitioners of Sanatan Dharma tries their luck in the Dravidian state. The issue of an alleged ‚ÄòHindi Imposition‚Äô also lessens chances of BJP establishing control in Tamil nadu. Loosing their Dravidian alliance with loosely thoguht comments can potentially prove fatal for the saffron party in the southern state.¬†    ¬†

"Rahul Gandhi questions Telangana CM's proximity with BJP, asks ‚Äòwhy no ED, CBI, I-T cases against him‚Äô","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday attacked Telangana Chief Minister and Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) supremo K. Chandrashekar Rao and questioned his proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP. Rahul Gandhi asked why there is no case against Telangana CM when ED, CBI, and Income Tax Department are after all the opposition leaders. 







    ""There is some case against every opposition leader. ED, CBI, and Income Tax Department are after all the opposition leaders but there is no case against Telangana CM, or there is no case against AIMIM leaders... PM Narendra Modi never attacks his own people, he considers your CM and AIMIM party as his own, hence there is no case against him. He has broken all records of corruption but there is no case against him,"" Rahul Gandhi said addressing a rally in Telangana. 




   Intensifying his jibe against K. Chandrashekar Rao, Rahul Gandhi said ""We call BRS party as 'BJP Rishtedaar Samithi.""        While talking about how the Congress-led UPA fulfilled the promise of the creation of Telangana, Rahul Gandhi emphasized that Sonia Gandhi delivers whatever she promises.    ""I saw Sonia (Gandhi) ji's speech. Whatever Sonia ji says she fulfils it. She does not speak loudly but when she says something, she does it,"" Rahul Gandhi said and recalled how the Congress fulfilled the promise of creation of Telangana. ""We did not give statehood to Telangana for the benefit of KCR and his family,"" he said.  Six guarantees of CongressRahul Gandhi spoke about the six guarantees Congress has promised for Telangana if it is voted to power. The first guarantee is about providing  ‚Çπ5 lakh for the construction of houses for all those who don't have one. The second is the Mahalakshmi scheme in which  ‚Çπ2,500 will be given to women, a cylinder for Rs. 500, and free travel in buses.

The virtues of 'Sanatana Dharama' are honesty, no injury to living beings, purity, charity, patience... Do they have even one of these qualities? Can they ever be 'Sanatanis'?

INDIA has hidden agenda to end Sanatana Dharma: PM Modi on Udhayanidhi Stalin's remark,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday elaborately spoke about the controversy surrounding the Sanatana Dharma remark made by Tamil Nadu minister Udhayanidhi Stalin. Addressing a massive gathering at Bina in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, PM Modi said that the INDIA alliance has a ‚Äúhidden agenda"" to attack and end the Sanatana Dharma culture. 







    Unleashing a no holds barred attack on the Opposition bloc ‚Äî the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) ‚Äî PM Narendra Modi called it an ‚ÄúINDI alliance"" that ‚Äúdoes not have a leader"". 




   ‚ÄúAt a time when Bharat is emerging as a world leader at global forums, some parties are trying to divide the country and its people. These people came together to form an ‚ÄòINDI‚Äô alliance. Some people are calling it a ‚Äòghamndiya (arrogant) alliance‚Äô. They don‚Äôt have a leader yet and there is a lot of suspense on who would lead them going into the Lok Sabha elections next year. They are working with a hidden agenda, which is to¬†attack India's culture,"" PM Modi said.        PM Modi also alleged that in its third meeting, the Opposition bloc adopted a resolution to ‚Äúend the Sanatana culture"" in the country.    The prime minister said, ‚ÄúThis INDI-Alliance adopted a resolution to end our 'Sanatana' culture. They are bent on destroying the ideologies, cultures and traditions that have kept the country and our people together for centuries.""    PM Modi's attack on the Opposition came a few days after CM MK Stalin's son, Udhayanidhi Stalin, said that Sanatana Dharma is incompatible with the concept of social justice and should be ‚Äúeliminated."" ‚ÄúSanatana is like malaria and dengue and so it must be eradicated and not opposed,"" Udhayanidhi Stalin said.    PM Modi addressed the meeting after¬†laying the foundation for several projects worth more than  ‚Çπ50,700 crores, including the 'Petrochemical Complex' at Bina Refinery and ten new industrial projects across Madhya Pradesh.    The 10 projects for which he laid the foundation stone include a¬†‚ÄòPower and Renewable Energy Manufacturing Zone‚Äô in the Narmadapuram district; two IT parks in Indore; a Mega Industrial Park in Ratlam; and six new industrial areas across the state.

‚ÄòPrime Minister of Bharat‚Äô: Sambit Patra shares invitation of PM Modi's Indonesia visit amid India's name change rumour,"BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Tuesday shared official information regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Indonesia for the 20th ASEAN-India and the 18th East Asia summits in which he has been referred to as the ‚ÄòPrime Minister of Bharat‚Äô. 







    The reference to PM Modi Modi as the ""Prime Minister of Bharat"" comes close on the heels of a G20 invite for a Presidential dinner on September 9 in the name of the ‚ÄúPresident of Bharat"".¬† 




   This triggered a row as opposition parties alleged that the central government is planning to drop India and stay with just Bharat as the country's name. Customarily, in English, the country is referred to as India.    




   Senior BJP leaders and ministers have cheered the move by the Rashtrapati Bhavan with Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar asking what is the problem with using ""President of Bharat"" as the country is also Bharat.    It also fuelled the speculation that the issue of changing the name of the country could come up during the five-day special session of Parliament beginning September 18.¬†    Opposition leaders, including Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, who first highlighted the development, accused the government of assaulting the idea of the country being a ""Union of States"", as mentioned in the Constitution which describes the country as ""India, that is Bharat"".    Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""So the news is indeed true. Rashtrapati Bhawan has sent out an invite for a G20 dinner on 9 September in the name of ‚ÄòPresident of Bharat‚Äô instead of the usual ‚ÄòPresident of India‚Äô.""Now, Article 1 in the Constitution can read: Bharat, that was India, shall be a Union of States.""    The row came four days after Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat made a strong pitch for using Bharat instead of India.    Addressing an event in Guwahati on 1 September, Bhagwat said the country‚Äôs name as Bharat has continued since ancient times and must be taken forward.¬†    ‚ÄúThe name of our country has been Bharat for ages. Whatever may be the language, the name remains the same,"" the RSS chief said.    ¬†  (With PTI inputs)

No rakhi for Rahul Gandhi? Congress issues clarification as BJP scrutinises Wayanad MP's wrist,"The Congress found itself locked into an unlikely debate with the BJP on Sunday over Rahul Gandhi's wrist. Debate about the Wayanad MP's current relationship sister Priyanka Gandhi raged on social media with both parties sharing conflicting videos to back their assertion. The BJP insisted that the siblings had fallen out - citing the lack of a rakhi on Gandhi's hand - and laid forward several reasons for the same. As the clip went viral, the Congress stepped forward with a video of their own ‚Äì where Gandhi did indeed have a rakhi tied to his wrist. 







    ‚ÄúDo talk about the issues sometime - now being frustrated Rahul ji did not tie Rakhi, you are spreading lies. This anger is natural because of the war waged by both the brothers and sisters against your market of lies and hatred. Hey guys, get both your eyes and brain treated, Rahul ji not only tied a rakhi, but he keeps tying that rakhi throughout the year,"" tweeted party leader Supriya Shrinate in Hindi. 




   The BJP claimed that Priyanka Gandhi had hatched a 'conspiracy' after being 'sidelined' for years. To this end, she had advised Rahul Gandhi to not apologise amid the Modi surname row.    




   Gandhi had been attending the launch of Gruha Lakshmi Yojana in Karnataka as the country celebrated Raksha bandhan on August 30. He had then headed to Mumbai for the third meeting of Opposition bloc INDIA the next day. The speculative assertions began during this time with BJP leaders claiming there was a ‚Äútussle"" underway between Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.    ‚ÄúMy brother and I have and will always have only love, trust, respect and loyalty towards each other. Do not worry, we both brother-sister, along with millions of sisters and brothers of the country, will break the arrogance of your lies, loot and hollow propaganda together. Happy Raksha Bandhan. It is a festival of love between brother and sister, celebrate it with a positive spirit,"" the Congress general secretary tweeted in response to a post by BJP IT department head Amit Malviya.¬†    Other Opposition leaders including Shiv Sena (UBT) lawmaker Priyanka Chaturvedi have also lashed out at the BJP.¬†    ‚ÄúThe language and the content of this video tweeted by BJP handle, clearly suggests that the script written by Silly Souls Production and produced by Foolish Trolls Company. Must pity the new levels BJP can plumb to for their desperation to be in power,"" she tweeted.    (With inputs from agencies)

Congress says will gift Smriti Irani gas cylinder she carried in 2013-14,"Congress party‚Äôs national youth president Srinivas BV on Monday said that they have found the old cooking gas cylinder that Union minister Smriti Irani used to carry in 2013-14, which they bought it for  ‚Çπ21,000 and it will be gifted back to her. 







    ‚ÄúIrani is making a lot of statements these days, I want to tell her that the old gas cylinder she used to carry in 2013-2014, we found out that cylinder and bought it for  ‚Çπ21,000. We will gift it to her,"" Srinivas said. 




   He made the comment while talking to media persons in Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs Indore district on Monday.        ‚ÄúThey (BJP) forgot what they used to say about the then Manmohan Singh government, he was making them recall. They had said inflation was made dayan (witch). The BJP leaders are doing the work of making the same inflation sit in the bedroom by making it a darling. Why?"" said the Congress leader.    The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was wasting its time in Madhya Pradesh and they were going to wash out from here in the upcoming assembly polls, Srinivas claimed.    The assembly elections in the state are slated to be held later this year.    ‚ÄúBJP is wasting its time in MP. They are going to get clear from here. In this 50 per cent commission government, 35 per cent commission is being transferred to Delhi and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh is getting the remaining 15 per cent,"" the Congress youth leader alleged.    When asked BJP is claiming Rahul Gandhi will never become the prime minister, Srinivas said that Rahul Gandhi would become prime minister in 2024.    On BJP‚Äôs remarks over Rahul Gandhi spreading kerosene, Srinivas¬† said that they (BJP) say anything in the name of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi to please PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.

'PM Modi's charisma would benefit Maharashtra': Ajit Pawar amid speculations of joining Sharad Pawar,"Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday said he was hopeful that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's charisma will benefit the state which follows secular thoughts. The remarks came while addressing a rally in the Beed district, according to a report published by the news agency PTI.¬† 







    The NCP leader said that nobody is a permanent friend or foe in politics, while also thanking local leaders of Shiv Sena and BJP for welcoming him along with other party leaders in the Maharashtra government.¬† 




   In the rally, Ajit Pawar said, ‚ÄúNobody is permanent friend or foe in politics. This is politics. It is our expectation that PM Modi's charisma would benefit Maharashtra and hence we all decided to join the (BJP-Shiv Sena) government for the benefit of the state.""        He further clarified that there is ‚Äòno self-interest‚Äô behind joining the Maharashtra government and dismissed any kind of speculative talks in this matter, as per PTI reports.¬†    ‚ÄúI am a person who likes to work and like to speak through my work. I won't respond to comments made against me by anyone,"" Ajit Pawar said.¬†    Notably, Ajit Pawar's uncle and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had addressed a rally in Beed ten days ago.¬†    In July, Ajit Pawar and eight other NCP MLAs joined the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra. He was then sworn in as a Deputy Chief Minister of the state along with BJP‚Äôs Devendra Fadnavis.    However, there are speculation that Ajit Pawar might be willing to join Sharad Pawar's party again. With the Ajit Pawar group still using Sharad Pawar‚Äôs picture on some of its billboards, it is clear that the faction is not confident of winning elections without the support of Sharad Pawar.    The Pawar senior has consistently maintained that he is against joining hands with the BJP and has called Ajit Pawar and other MLAs ‚Äúcowards"" without taking their names.    On Friday, Sharad Pawar claimed that there was no split on NCP and Ajit Pawar is its leader, however, he denied his statement within hours, PTI reported.¬†    He had also said that the opportunity to correct oneself is given once but the opportunity cannot be given again or one shouldn't ask for it again, apparently referring to Ajit Pawar's early-morning oath ceremony with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis after the 2019 assembly polls.    ¬†  (With PTI inputs)

RSS Defamation Case: Rahul Gandhi moves Bombay HC against Thane court order,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has moved the Bombay High Court challenging the Thane court order in the RSS defamation case. The court had earlier taken the transcript of the alleged defamatory speech as evidence in the pending criminal defamation case filed by an RSS worker Rajesh Kunte.¬† 







    Rahul Gandhi claimed that the Magistrate's order was in violation of an order of a single judge of the High Court in another petition filed by Kunte which was related to the same defamation complaint, according to a report published by Bar and Bench.¬† 




   Bhiwandi-based RSS activist Rajesh Kunte had filed a defamation suit against the Gandhi scion for holding the organization responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.¬†        Kunte‚Äôs suit claims that Gandhi, in an election speech on 6 March 2014, in Bhiwandi said that ‚ÄúRSS people killed Mahatma Gandhi"".¬†    The Congress leader appeared in court for the first time in this case on 8 July 2015. He challenged the case in the Supreme Court on 8 September 2016, but later withdrew his petition saying he would fight the case in the Bhiwandi court.    Earlier in March this year, Rahul Gandhi faced a fresh defamation case. A complaint was filed with a Haridwar court in connection with remarks made by the former MP during the Bharat Jodo Yatra. Gandhi had described the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) as ‚Äú21st century Kauravas"" during an address in January.    The issue - one in a series of flashpoints between the Congress party and the ruling BJP - has however served to united numerous opposition parties. Many of them accuse the Centre of diverting attention from the Adani-Hindenburg issue.

"Congress' Jairam Ramesh brands PM Modi as 'tsunami of lies', shares article labeling him as 'fascist","In a fresh attack on PM Modi over his Parliament speech during the recently-concluded monsoon session, Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said that the Prime Minister always speaks a tsunami of lies. 







    The Congress leader also share an excerpt from an article that he claimed was written by Ashis Nandy, one of India's leading scholars trained as a clinical psychologist. In the article, Nandy called Modi a ‚Äúclassic, and clinical case of a fascist"". 




   In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Jairam Ramesh said, ‚ÄúEverytime the PM speaks it is a torrent of abuse, a tsunami of lies. His recent speech in Parliament made me recall what Ashis Nandy, one of India's leading scholars trained as a clinical psychologist, wrote in early 2002 in the Seminar magazine. This is the crucial excerpt.""    




   ‚ÄúMore than a decade ago, when Narendra Modi was a nobody, a small-time RSS pracharak trying to make it as a small-time BJP functionary, I had the privilege of interviewing him along with Achyut Yagnik, whom Modi could not fortunately recognize. It was a long, rambling interview, but it left me in no doubt that here was a classic, clinical case of a fascist. I never use the term ‚Äòfascist‚Äô as a term of abuse; to me, it is a diagnostic category comprising not only one‚Äôs ideological posture but also the personality traits and motivational patterns contextualizing the ideology,"" the article read.¬†    The Congress leader's remarks came after PM Modi slammed the Opposition bloc Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) and called it a ""ghamandiya"" (arrogant) alliance.¬†    He also recounted the dramatic events in Parliament, claiming that the Opposition abandoned their own motion midway, unable to face the prospect of a vote.    ""The truth is that the opposition got scared of voting on a no-confidence motion. Had there been voting, the 'ghamandiya' alliance would have been exposed,"" ANI quoted PM Modi as saying.    The no-confidence motion, spearheaded by the opposition, was tabled on July 26. Throughout the ensuing three-day debate, tensions flared between the ruling and Opposition factions, particularly around issues like the Manipur violence.

Rahul Gandhi's ‚Äòflying kiss‚Äô was a gesture of love and affection: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi,"As a controversy erupted over Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's alleged ‚Äòflying kiss‚Äô gesture, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi termed the gesture ‚Äúaffectionate"". 







    ""I don't understand that when he was speaking, all the ministers were standing up. Ministers were creating obstructions. He made an affectionate gesture, what problem do you have with it? You are habitual of so much hatred that you fail to understand any gesture of love, of affection,"" Chaturvedi said as quoted by ANI. 




   She further said that Rahul Gandhi's words were not driven by animosity, despite his disqualification and subsequent legal victory.        ‚ÄúYou disqualified Rahul Gandhi as an MP and ousted him from his residence. He came back after winning his cases. Still, he is not talking to you out of hatred. If you have a problem, it is your problem and nobody else's,"" the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader said.  Only a misogynistic man who can give a flying kiss to a Parliament: Smriti IraniOn Wednesday, Union Minister Smriti Irani, along with several BJP MPs, voiced their strong objections following an alleged flying kiss gesture made by Gandhi towards BJP MPs in the Lok Sabha. However, the incident was not caught on camera    ‚ÄúThe one who was given the chance to speak before me, displayed indecency before leaving. It is only a misogynistic man who can give a flying kiss to a Parliament which seats female members of Parliament. Such undignified conduct has never before seen in the Parliament of the country...,"" Irani said.    Demanding strict action against Rahul Gandhi, National Democratic Alliance (NDA) women MPs wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker OM Birla alleging the Congress MP of making inappropriate gesture and displaying indecent behaviour in the House.    In a complaint, signed by more than 20 women parliamentarians, it was alleged that the Congress member made an ""inappropriate gesture"" towards Irani when was speaking in the House.¬†  (With inputs from agencies)

'A victory for justice'! Congress celebrates as Lok Sabha restores 'Wayanad MP' Rahul Gandhi's membership | WATCH,"Congress party on Monday was in a mood of celebration after the Lok Sabha secretariat restored the membership of party leader Rahul Gandhi. Gandhi's membership as MP from Kerala's Wayanad constituency got restored during the Monsoon Session of the Parliament on Monday. 







    The Lok Sabha Secretariat on Monday issued a notification announcing that his disqualification has been revoked. 




 Gandhi was disqualified from the lower house in March 2023 after a Gujarat court convicted him in a defamation case and sentenced him to two years in jail.        A punishment of two years and above automatically disqualifies a lawmaker.    On Friday, the Supreme Court stayed his conviction in the criminal defamation case of the use of the 'Modi' surname.    The Congress leader had challenged the trial court order at the Gujarat High Court, which upheld the ruling of the lower court.    However, the SC observed that no reason was given by the trial court judge while convicting him except that he was admonished by the apex court in a contempt case.    Former Gujarat minister Purnesh Modi had filed a criminal defamation case in 2019 against Gandhi over his ""How come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?"" remark made during an election rally in Kolar, Karnataka, on April 13, 2019.    Hailing the decision by the Lok Sabha secretariat, following the apex court's order, senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ""With enormous relief, welcome the official announcement of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs reinstatement. He can now resume his duties in the Lok Sabha to serve the people of India and his constituents in Wayanad. A victory for justice and for our democracy!"".




   Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury put a piece of sweet inside Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge's mouth. Other INDIA alliances also celebrated the restoration of Lok Sabha membership of Rahul Gandhi today.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/rahul-gandhi-congress-celebrates-as-lok-sabha-restores-wayanad-mp-membership-11691384375019.html,120,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.101,0.059,0.839,0.958

    ""There is no other personality in the country who has popularity like Modi ji. Look at the work he has done‚Ä¶, the kind of respect India gets at the global level,"" the deputy CM said while speaking to PTI. 




   ""Indira Gandhi used to get similar kind of respect (when she visited other countries)....Rajiv Gandhi had an image of Mr Clean. Similarly, we are seeing (that) in the form of Modi,"" he said.        Pawar was speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Pune where PM Modi received the Lokmanya Tilak National Award.  ‚ÄòNobody supported whatever that is happening in Manipur‚ÄôSpeaking on the Manipur violence and oppositions demand that PM should speak at the Parliament, he said, ""Any prime minister will think of having a good atmosphere in the country from the law and order point of view. Nobody supported whatever that is happening in Manipur. The prime minister has taken cognizance of the issue. Chief Justice of India has also taken cognizance. Everyone has condemned whatever happened there. ""    The Centre and the Manipur government are ensuring the culprits of May 3 incident (where two women were paraded naked) are punished, he said.  ‚ÄòThere is no other leader with popularity like PM Modi at the international level‚ÄôPraising PM for working long hours tirelessly, Pawar said. ""During Diwali, while rest of the country celebrates Diwali at home, he celebrates it with army soldiers on the borders,"" he said.    ""We have been seeing his work for the last nine years. There is no other leader with popularity like Modi at the international level. The truth is the truth. I want development. Being in an opposition party, we can stage protests and take out morchas, but the decision lies with those who are in power,"" Pawar said.

"BJP leaders claim success in stifling Rahul Yatra in Assam, ensuring it did not gain momentum in NE","ASSAM CHIEF Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma‚Äôs constant attacks on Rahul Gandhi during the Congress leader‚Äôs Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra through the state carried the whiff of the bitterness in which their ties had ended. However, sources close to Sarma say, the CM‚Äôs offensive was also strategic, as it kept Rahul caught up in trying to firefight the Assam situation.
Rahul entered Assam shortly after launching the second leg of his Bharat Jodo Yatra from Manipur, a state where a nine-month-long internal conflict has put the BJP government on the back foot. There was some apprehension in BJP circles that Rahul would carry the momentum of the Manipur kick-off into Assam, and generate a good response, especially among the Muslim community in Assam, that makes up more than 35% of the state‚Äôs population.
Instead, Rahul‚Äôs Yatra found itself caught up in scuffles with security forces, over permissions of various sorts. On the day of the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration, for example, with all eyes on what Rahul would do ‚Äì after top Congress leaders had pulled out of the event ‚Äì he was not allowed to visit a revered Assam shrine. While he did a sit-in to mark his protest, Rahul eventually had to give up, and concede to the Assam government.

Assam BJP sources say Sarma also ensured that Rahul was distracted from his main Yatra theme of attacking the Modi government. An offensive against the Prime Minister would have got Rahul eyeballs among the opponents of the BJP, which in turn would have given the Congress leader a boost ahead of his Yatra‚Äôs entry into West Bengal and Bihar, where it is covering or will cover minority-dominated areas.
BJP leaders, in fact, claim that the way Rahul‚Äôs Yatra had progressed in Assam had spurred on Trinamool Congress Mamata Banerjee to flex muscles and declare the INDIA alliance all but over in West Bengal, just two days ahead of the march‚Äôs entry into her state.
An enthusiastic response in Assam might have made her reluctant to do so, a BJP leader claimed. Her move, in turn, triggered a dynamo reaction among other INDIA partners.

A senior BJP leader based in Delhi said: ‚ÄúThe Assam CM‚Äôs constant attacks on the Congress leader meant many in the public were reluctant to be seen around his Yatra.‚ÄùAdvertisement
Officially though, the BJP maintained that Sarma was guided purely by law and order considerations, a claim repeated by a party leader from Assam.
The Congress countered the BJP‚Äôs claims regarding the Yatra, with party Assam MP Gaurav Gogoi, who played a key role in it, insisting that it had been ‚Äúa huge success‚Äù in the state.
‚ÄúThe Assam chapter of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra touched upon the most important issue on people‚Äôs minds, which is the rampant corruption associated with the CM and his immediate family. The tag of ‚Äòthe most corrupt CM‚Äô rattled Sarma, and his attempts to block the Yatra escalated after that comment,‚Äù Gogoi told The Indian Express.Advertisement
He also claimed that the state government not letting Rahul visit the Batadrava Than shrine on January 22 ‚Äúboomeranged‚Äù on the BJP and earned tremendous goodwill for the Yatra. ‚ÄúSubsequently, in Guwahati on January 23, we witnessed a huge crowd for the Congress despite no local MLAs of the party in the city,‚Äù Gogoi said, lauding Rahul for raising issues central to the situation in the Northeast, including the conflict in Manipur, the unresolved Naga political issue, and Sarma‚Äôs ‚Äúobscene‚Äù corruption.
‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to build on the momentum generated by the Yatra and prepare the ground for the Lok Sabha elections,‚Äù Gogoi said.
As per BJP sources, the party‚Äôs public posturing notwithstanding, it had been taken aback by the response to Rahul‚Äôs first Yatra (September 2022-January 2023), including through party-ruled states (which was seen as reflecting poorly on BJP state units) ‚Äì despite the Yatra‚Äôs political gains remaining limited.
This time, the BJP was particularly conscious about not letting Rahul cash in on the resentment in many parts of the Northeast due to the Manipur situation. Sources point to Union Home Minister Amit Shah‚Äôs three-day visit to Meghalaya and Assam beginning January 18 to address the plenary session of the North Eastern Council, four days after Rahul‚Äôs Yatra started.
BJP sources admitted it had been a hurriedly organised programme, after Rahul had announced his Yatra.Advertisement
A party source said that given Sarma‚Äôs long innings in the Congress before he joined the BJP, the CM was particularly sensitive about the message that went out about the Yatra from Assam.
As a BJP leader said, ‚ÄúHad Rahul made Assam the launching pad of the second leg of his Yatra, Sarma would have faced a lot of flak in the party. It would have been worse for him because of his past in the Congress.‚Äù",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-leaders-rahul-yatra-assam-ne-9136211/,122,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.135,0.044,0.82,0.9923
"How Places of Worship Act was debated in Parliament:  ‚ÄòForeclosing future rows‚Äô, ‚Äòwhy Ayodhya only exception‚Äô","How the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi mosque title suit is settled may come down to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act essentially declare that the religious character of a place of worship, barring the then-contested Rajanmabhoomi in Ayodhya, will continue to be the same as on August 15, 1947, and that no person shall convert any place of worship of any religious denomination into one of a different denomination or section.
The Supreme Court is in the process of hearing whether the 1991 Act bars even the filing of such a plea regarding any other place of worship. So far, only oral observations have been submitted, with the Court yet to conclusively rule on the issue.
The 1991 Act had been brought in by the then Congress government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao at a time when the Ram temple movement was at its peak. The Babri Masjid was still standing, but L K Advani‚Äôs rath yatra, his arrest in Bihar, and the firing on kar sevaks in Uttar Pradesh had raised communal tensions. The Congress argued that the Bill would help prevent future communal clashes.
The Bill was introduced in the 1991 Monsoon Session, and saw at least eight hours of debate, marred by frequent interruptions and expunged remarks, with intense opposition from the BJP‚Äôs side. Over the course of the debate, spread out over three days, both sides claimed that their position would ensure communal harmony.

Ultimately, the Bill was passed without any major amendments and retained the exclusion of Ayodhya and Jammu and Kashmir from its purview. A year later, in December 1992, the Babri Masjid was destroyed by activists of the VHP and other Hindu groups, leading to communal violence across the country. Narasimha Rao was heavily criticised for his government‚Äôs handling of the situation, including permitting the BJP-led UP government, which refused to use central paramilitary forces, to oversee security measures.
In 2022, Krishna Pal Singh Yadav, the BJP MP from Guna, introduced a private member‚Äôs Bill for repeal of the Act. However, it has not yet come up for discussion.
A look back at the debate in Parliament over the 1991 Act:
Government standAdvertisement
The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by then Home Minister S B Chavan with the objective of ‚Äúprohibiting conversion of places of worship and to provide for the maintenance of their religious character as it existed on August 15, 1947‚Äù.
The Congress had promised to introduce the Bill in its 1991 election manifesto and it was also mentioned in the President‚Äôs address to Parliament earlier that year.
‚ÄúIt is considered necessary to adopt these measures in view of the controversies arising from time to time with regard to conversion of places of worship, which tend to vitiate the communal atmosphere,‚Äù Chavan said after introducing the Bill. ‚ÄúI am sure that enactment of this Bill will go a long way in helping restore communal amity and goodwill.‚ÄùAdvertisement

Near the end of the debate on the Bill, Chavan said, ‚ÄúIn recent years, we have noticed with anxiety an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests. One of the methods‚Ä¶ is taking resort to forcible conversion of places of worship to create new disputes and to rake up old controversies‚Ä¶ We consider it necessary to take steps to put an immediate end to such unfortunate conflicts and foreclose any new controversies. This Bill‚Ä¶ seeks to achieve this objective.‚Äù
BJP stand
The BJP said the Bill fell ‚Äúoutside the legislative competence‚Äù of the Lok Sabha. Jaswant Singh, then the BJP MP from Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, who would later become a Union minister under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government that followed, led the debate for the party. Singh argued that the Bill was ‚Äúviolative of the Constitution‚Äù since it legislated on an issue reserved for state governments.
The state list in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution includes ‚Äúpilgrimages, other than pilgrimages to places outside India‚Äù. Singh‚Äôs contention was that ‚Äúif places of worship are not places of pilgrimage, then what else are they‚Äù.
Singh also said that since many places of worship were linked to burial and cremation sites, another subject under the state list, the Bill encroached on states‚Äô rights.
Jaswant Singh went on to call the Bill violative of the fundamental right to religion, citing sections of the Constitution that say every religious denomination or section has the right ‚Äúto own and acquire movable and immovable property‚Äù and ‚Äúto administer such property in accordance with law‚Äù.Advertisement
‚ÄúI think we are somewhere impinging on this fundamental right. It is of course a Constitutional question and you will ask me to explain whether a Constitutional question can be raised, but I consider it prudent to raise this now and here,‚Äù Singh said.
The BJP also opposed the exclusion of J&K from the Bill. ‚ÄúI believe that with the exclusion of Jammu and Kashmir, where it is well enough known that a great many temples have been desecrated, would it not be violative of basic and fundamental equity and the Constitution?‚Äù Singh said.Advertisement
Many of Singh‚Äôs BJP colleagues were more hostile in their criticism of the Bill. BJP MP Ram Naik, from Bombay North, who went on to become a Union minister under Vajpayee, called it the ‚Äúblackest Bill in Indian Parliament‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis Bill proposes to legalise all encroachments upon Hindu temples made during Mughal and British rule,‚Äù he said.
Advani, who led the rath yatra, was at the time the Leader of the Opposition, and would go on to be an accused in the Babri Masjid case (later acquitted), only briefly expressed his opposition to the Bill before staging a walk-out. ‚ÄúI believe that this Bill is thoroughly ill-conceived. The Bill is totally unwarranted‚Ä¶ We cannot associate ourselves with this Bill. We are opposing its introduction,‚Äù he said.Advertisement
Uma Bharti, a firebrand BJP MP from Khajuraho who would also be later among the acquitted accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, cited a sub-clause in the Bill that said that any existing legal disputes on the conversion of religious sites would cease after the enactment of the law, to claim that the dispute over the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi would be settled outside the courts.
‚ÄúI am very glad that though the Congress government might not agree with us on various issues, yet it appears that it‚Ä¶ has accepted our view that issues of faith cannot be decided in courts. I would be thankful to the government that Ayodhya has been excluded from the purview of this Bill. All this shows that the government does not want confrontation and we also do not want confrontation, although we are not afraid of any confrontation,‚Äù Bharti said.
Bharti suggested that the Bill would encourage communal violence. ‚ÄúI heard in childhood that pigeons fear the presence of cats. Pigeons are so innocent that they believe the mere closing of eyes will prove to be an effective shield against cats. But this is not correct. Maintenance of the status quo as in 1947, in respect of religious places, is like closing eyes like pigeons against the advancement of cats. This maintenance of the status quo of 1947 will mean preservation of tension for the coming generations,‚Äù she said.
Bharti also spoke about a visit to the disputed Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, where she claimed to have seen ‚Äúremnants of the temple‚Äù. ‚ÄúSome sort of current of anger ran through my body. I felt disgraced at the fate of my ancestors‚Ä¶ Was not the intention of Aurangzeb behind leaving remnants of a temple at the site of the mosque to keep reminding Hindus of their historical fate and to remind coming generations of Muslims of their past glory and power?‚Ä¶ l would like to know from the movers of the Bill, why they want to preserve and protect the wrong done by Aurangzeb‚Ä¶ Why are they keeping the bone of contention alive?‚Äù she said, adding that the Bill was a form of ‚Äúappeasement‚Äù.
Other BJP MPs, including Rajasthan legislator Guman Mal Lodha, said the Bill was unnecessary as other laws already offered the same protections. ‚ÄúThere is already a law regarding the trespassing of property‚Ä¶ This law is an illusory law and it is full of confusion. It is not going to benefit either Hindu or Muslim,‚Äù he said.
Congress and other parties
P M Sayeed, the Congress‚Äôs then Lakshadweep MP, who supported the Bill, asked why the Ayodhya site had been left out of its purview. ‚ÄúI request the Home Minister to clarify why it is kept out of the Bill. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has circulated some series of letters in which they have (raised) not only Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi but also Varanasi, Mathura and Taj Mahal. They want to demolish all these,‚Äù he said.
The CPI(M)‚Äôs Somnath Chatterjee, the then MP from Bengal‚Äôs Bolpur, who would later become the Lok Sabha Speaker under the first UPA government, said his party would have preferred the inclusion of the Ayodhya dispute, but they accepted the Bill given that Ayodhya had become a ‚Äúgreat emotional issue‚Äù that should be solved by ‚Äúmutual discussion‚Äù.
He also questioned the BJP resorting to the pilgrimage argument. ‚ÄúAfter a good deal of searching and burning the midnight oil, they (the BJP) have come to‚Ä¶ pilgrimages‚Ä¶ So far as pilgrimage is concerned‚Ä¶ this Bill does not purport to restrict anybody going to a place of worship,‚Äù said Chatterjee, who also cited the dictionary definition of ‚Äòpilgrimage‚Äô in his remarks.
Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, an MP and then national president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), was stronger in his criticism on this point. ‚ÄúAs far as Section 5 of the Bill is concerned, it should be deleted because this keeps Babri Masjid out of the purview of the Bill. I cannot understand why this exception,‚Äù Sait said.
Hyderabad‚Äôs then AIMIM MP Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi and then Union minister of Parliamentary Affairs and J&K Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, however, argued that the Bill would help prevent further politicisation of religious issues.
‚ÄúI would like to ask those who are opposing this Bill as to why this Babri Masjid issue was not raised just after 1947 and why they did not raise the issue in 1977 during the Janata regime when‚Ä¶ Vajpayee and Advani (were ministers). Why do they raise this issue now? So one can easily understand that this is not simply an issue for them, rather they want to exploit it for acquiring power,‚Äù Owaisi said.
‚ÄúThe time has come when through this Bill we can impose some checks on some political parties which adopt religion as a means to win elections‚Ä¶ In my opinion, there is no law more effective than this law to maintain the unity and integrity of the country,‚Äù Azad said.
Digvijaya Singh, who was the Congress‚Äôs Rajgarh MP at the time, would later become the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and remains one of the party‚Äôs more strident voices against Hindutva, was among those against the exclusion of J&K from the Bill.
‚ÄúI would urge the Home minister to reconsider this decision and not to allow our friends on this side to create a kind of propaganda against this Bill. They would be exploiting this Bill for their own political ends, which is quite obvious, seeing their performance in this House. That is why, I urge the Home minister to‚Ä¶ extend it to the state of J&K,‚Äù he said.
The late Ram Vilas Paswan, who was the Janata Dal MP from Bihar‚Äôs Rosera at the time, said the Bill was ‚Äúbetter late than never‚Äù. ‚ÄúHad the Congress party brought such a legislation earlier, I am certain that‚Ä¶ the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute would not have arisen‚Ä¶ We have far more important problems before us‚Ä¶ This country cannot afford to squabble over trifling issues like mandir or masjid,‚Äù he said.

"Nitish Kumar hits back, slams Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs ‚Äòfaltu baat‚Äô on caste survey, Tejashwi for jobs claim","A DAY AFTER Congress leader Rahul Gandhi broke his silence over the exit of Nitish Kumar from the INDIA bloc and attributed it to his ‚Äúreluctance‚Äù to conduct a caste survey, the Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) supremo joined words with him.
In his first such remarks attacking his former partners at length, Nitish said it was ‚Äúfaltu baat (useless talk)‚Äù on Rahul‚Äôs part to try and take credit for the caste survey done by the Mahagathbandhan government led by him. He also questioned RJD leader and his former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav saying that it was his party‚Äôs ministers who had led the job push under the Mahagathbandhan government.

In another swipe at the INDIA alliance, Nitish said it ‚Äúhad not achieved anything‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have nothing to do with it now. In fact, I was against calling it INDIA. But they decided to go with this name. I had taken initiative to form it, but it did not do a single thing. Hence, I have walked out of it and joined the NDA. Ab yehi rahenge (I will stick to the NDA now).‚Äù
The acronym, standing for ‚ÄòIndian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance‚Äô, is believed to have been arrived at by the Congress and Trinamool Congress jointly at INDIA‚Äôs Bengaluru meeting, with other partners taken by surprise.
On Rahul‚Äôs remarks at the Purnea rally, which was part of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, that they had made Nitish agree to do the caste survey, the CM said: ‚ÄúNonsense. Everyone knows I got the resolution passed in 2019 and 2020 for conducting a caste survey in Bihar. When the Central government did not conduct it for some reasons, we decided to go ahead and hold it in Bihar. We held meetings with nine parties.‚Äù
Nitish, in fact, was talking of a caste census since before he switched over from the NDA to join hands with the Mahagathbandhan in August 2022.
Asked about the allegation of the Opposition that the Central government was on a witch-hunt against its leaders, through probes by different agencies, Nitish said: ‚ÄúThese agencies are investigating old cases. It is part of the process of investigation.‚ÄùAdvertisement

He also claimed that it was only after he took over as CM in 2006, for the first time, that the state had embarked on the path of growth and development.
On Tejashwi comparing the achievements of the last 17 months of the Mahagathbandhan government to the 17 years Nitish has been CM, he said: ‚ÄúWhen I took over the reins of Bihar, he (Tejashwi) was a child. Everyone knows all the major development initiatives have been taken after 2006. Where were government jobs before 2006? We started recruiting teachers and giving jobs in other departments later.‚Äù",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/nitish-rahul-tejashwi-rjd-jdu-india-9137465/,124,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.099,0.079,0.822,0.9905
"With BJP‚Äôs three new faces, a new chapter for social justice in India","The BJP‚Äôs choice of chief ministers in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh marks the dawn of a new era in the politics of social justice in the country. The silent and remarkable commitment of the party leadership to not only cultivating leaders from marginalised sections but also consciously placing them in consequential positions of leadership is significant. Mohan Yadav, a leader from the OBC communities, has been named chief minister in Madhya Pradesh, Dalit leader Jagdish Devda is the Deputy CM; in Chhattisgarh, tribal leader Vishnu Deo Sai is the new CM and the OBC leader Arun Sao is Deputy CM; Prem Chand Bairwa, another Dalit leader in Rajasthan, is the Deputy CM.
These appointments are a reflection of the BJP‚Äôs organisational commitment to the idea of real, not perceived, social justice.
Beyond the social diversity context, these leaders have much to offer. Factors like smooth generational shift and a focus on qualification and merit should also be considered. The majority of them have spent their life in public service as representatives and carry academic credentials. CM Mohan Yadav has a PhD, for example. In a stern message to the cadre-based organisation, the premium on experience and ideological commitment has been reinforced.
In his book, The New BJP: Modi and the Making of the World‚Äôs Largest Political Party, Nalin Mehta makes a compelling observation, ‚ÄúIn June 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out in a video address to his party workers that the BJP was represented by 113 OBC, 43 ST and 53 SC MPs in the Lok Sabha. In other words, a full 37.2 per cent of the BJP Lok Sabha MPS were OBC, 14.1 per cent ST and 17.4 per cent SC. This means that a whopping 68.9 per cent (209) of all its 303 Lok Sabha MPs elected in 2019 were non-upper caste and were from castes that were traditionally considered lower down in the caste hierarchy. This is strikingly on par with the widely accepted national share of the population of these castes: 69.2 per cent.‚Äù It is established that Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs oft-repeated and unoriginal rhetoric on representation based on the share of the population was nothing but hollow demagoguery.
Congress‚Äôs hypocrisy on caste and social justice is no longer a matter of surprise. Only recently during the oath-taking ceremony of the Chief Minister of Telangana, Revanth Reddy consciously did not touch the feet of Mallikarjun Kharge, who comes from the Dalit community, right after he touched Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs feet. For a community that has faced years of institutional ostracisation, these things matter and must not be ignored. The Dalit imagination asks for respect, recognition and representation. The recent struggle between Mallikarjun Kharge and D K Sivakumar on the release of the caste census report in Karnataka is another brick in the wall of the ambivalence of the Congress party on the caste census. It is imperative to do a historical analysis of Congress in terms of the representation of Dalits. In her book, How Prime Ministers Decide, Neerja Chowdhury observes the reflection of one of the tallest Dalit leaders after Ambedkar, Jagjivan Ram, ‚ÄúA chamar can never be the Prime Minister of this country‚Äù. Further, it reads, ‚ÄúFor Indira Gandhi, it came as a windfall. ‚ÄòKissi bhi keemat par Jagjivan Ram Pradhan Mantri nahi banana chahiye,‚Äô she would tell her confidantes. ‚ÄòHatenge nahi zindagi bhar.‚Äô‚Äù It is noteworthy but not pertinent to mention the machinations that were orchestrated against him and his son in the subsequent years.
Congress as an organisation is structurally, characteristically, a feudal party that has never encouraged real inclusive leadership. The Madhya Pradesh elections brought forth a deep faultline ‚Äî Akhilesh Yadav, a prominent OBC leader, was called names and insulted by the senior leadership of the Congress party.
The recent political appointments will open a new chapter in the life of Indian democracy. There is a renewed sense of hope and aspiration within marginalised sections after decades of mere symbolism. From the first tribal woman at the highest constitutional office to the first elected tribal CM in Chhattisgarh, an extraordinary faith in the Dalit leadership is a sign of times to come. This will challenge the conventional wisdom of caste and communities rallying behind family-based political enterprises which are distinctly unwilling to explore power-sharing beyond one family.

"Decode Politics: In Telangana, the curious case of missing BRS government files","Just as the Revanth Reddy-led Congress administration seems to be settling down in Telangana, a curious case of damaged and missing government files has come up in the state. The blame has fallen on the aides of Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader and former Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav who is one of the CM‚Äôs oldest political rivals.
What is the case?
Earlier this week, barely days after the Congress government took charge in the state, several key files in the animal husbandry department were found either missing or damaged.
Yadav‚Äôs Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Kalyan Kumar and four others were booked following a complaint by a security guard at the department. The watchman, in his complaint, told the police that he saw Kumar, computer operators Mohan and Elija, and attendants Venkatesh and Prashanth in the office at the time of the incident. The watchman discovered the damaged files during a routine check.

Apart from the missing files, some security cameras in the department were also found to be broken, raising suspicions about the incident. Kumar has alleged he is being implicated in the case because of political reasons and has approached the Telangana High Court seeking anticipatory bail.
What files were these?
Sources said the destroyed and ‚Äúsome stolen‚Äù files pertained to the procurement of fodder for cattle. A Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, ‚ÄúImagine the scale of corruption that they were in such a hurry to destroy files which would expose their malpractices.‚Äù
BRS insiders, however, said the minister had nothing to do with the incident. ‚ÄúIf the minister had to hide something, he could have taken the files while vacating the office. He has nothing to do with it (the incident),‚Äù said a leader.
An old rivalry 
Both Yadav and Revanth were colleagues in the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Though they never had a public fallout, Yadav, who is senior to the CM, was known to be uncomfortable with Revanth‚Äôs meteoric rise in the party.Advertisement

Following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, Yadav was among the TDP leaders who joined the BRS (then Telangana Rashtra Samithi, or TRS). He gradually grew close to K Chandrashekar Rao, or KCR, and is known to be his close aide. Revanth, meanwhile, quit the TDP in 2017 and joined the Congress, where yet again he quickly rose up the ranks and became the state Congress chief.
Both leaders have been known to share an uneasy equation since their TDP days. During the recent Assembly election campaign, they engaged in a war of words, with Yadav telling Revanth to control his tongue. The Congress leader also faced backlash from the Golla-Kuruma communities for his comments against Yadav.
Political ramifications
The case of the missing files can potentially be the Pandora‚Äôs Box for the BRS. While the probe in the case is in its initial stages, any alleged irregularities will provide the Congress and the BJP with an I-told-you-so moment ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. For the BRS, which has been accused of corruption during its nine-year rule, it would further dent the party‚Äôs prospects in the parliamentary polls.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/decode-politics-telangana-curious-case-missing-brs-government-files-9068154/,126,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.116,0.023,0.861,0.9967
"Statues of PM, Yogi ‚Äòguard‚Äô a rooftop temple against demolition in Bharuch","A scrap merchant‚Äôs solution to a looming demolition threat against his alleged unauthorised construction has caught the officials of the Bharuch-Ankleshwar Urban Development Authority (BAUDA) off guard. Mohanlal Gupta, who allegedly constructed an additional floor in a building he had bought last year, has now built a ‚Äútemple‚Äù with the idols of Lord Ram, Sita and Laxman. What more, statues resembling Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stand ‚Äòguard‚Äô outside the rooftop shrine.
Gupta, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, also went a step ahead and inaugurated the temple atop the purported illegal scrap godown on January 22 to coincide with the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya by PM Modi.
The scrap merchant‚Äôs unprecedented move came soon after BAUDA officials inspected the building following a complaint by Mansukh Rakhasiya, resident of Jantanagar society in Gadkhol village of Ankleshwar. After fresh complaints about the rooftop temple, BAUDA officials Tuesday visited the spot and found that Gupta had constructed an additional floor without prior permission.
BAUDA has now given him seven days to submit necessary documents. However, according to Gupta, Jitendra Oza, from whom he had bought the property last year, had already taken permission for the construction from Gadkhol Gram Panchayat in 2012.
Gupta alleged that envious people have complained against the structure. ‚ÄúI have made changes to the property by demolishing some parts. There are some people who are jealous of me and are threatening to get the structure demolished. They have also demanded money from me. They reside in a residential society far from our Riddhi Siddhi society,‚Äù he said.

According to Rakhasiya‚Äôs first complaint, lodged on July 11, 2023, ‚Äúno prior permission was taken‚Äù for alleged illegal constructions, including that of Gupta‚Äôs, in three residential societies of the village.
Apart from Gupta‚Äôs two-storey building in the Riddhi Siddhi residential society, one built by Ramjikumar Maurya in Arunodaynagar Society and another by Ravi Vishwakarma at Niravkunj Society were the other two named by the complainant.Advertisement
After the complaint failed to elicit action, he filed another application before Bharuch District Collector Tushar Sumera on December 1. Following this, BAUDA officials visited the site for an inspection on December 21.
On January 1 this year, Rakhasiya followed it up with a letter to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel detailing about the three constructions. This time, he also demanded that strict action be taken against BAUDA officials for their inaction.
On Tuesday, the BAUDA team visited the site again after Rakhasiya contacted them again with photos and videos from the inaugural event, invitations for which were extended to the village sarpanch and residents.Advertisement
Gadkhol village Sarpanch Manjulaben Patel said she did not attend the inauguration, but has learnt that a ‚Äúlarge number of people attended the event‚Äù. Photos and videos of the event have since gone viral on social media.
BAUDA incharge town planner Nitin Patel told The Indian Express that they have given seven days to Gupta to submit necessary documents of the plot and other details. ‚ÄúPrimarily, it has been found that the entire building was not renovated (as was claimed), but newly constructed. Gupta stays in a house just opposite to the new building at Riddhi Siddhi society. It is a residential society and he uses this building for commercial purposes. He had also made two shutters‚Ä¶ After seven days, on the basis of documents submitted by Gupta, further actions will be taken,‚Äù he said.
Further, he explained that Gupta had done sale deed documents in the name of his wife Kiran on January 21, 2023, after purchasing the structure from Oza. ‚ÄúThe sale deed document shows only the ground floor, but our team found a newly constructed building of ground plus one floor and terrace with a temple on the roof on Tuesday,‚Äù he said. He added that Gupta uses a common open plot, behind the scrap godown, for keeping waste gunny bags. ‚ÄúHowever, no construction activity has been done on it,‚Äù Patel added.
Rakhasiya, however, alleged that authorities have taken no action against illegal constructions in the village. ‚ÄúWe have also written to Bharuch Collector Tushar Sumera and Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and demanded that actions should be taken,‚Äù he told The Indian Express, adding that the rooftop temple with the statues was Gupta‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart‚Äù move to save his property from getting demolished.
Meanwhile, Gupta alleged that the complainant has been threatening him regularly. ‚ÄúI have built the temple on the rooftop and installed statues of PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogiji. I believe Mansukh and others did not like it. They are threatening me regularly. I request the district authorities to protect me from such people,‚Äù he said.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/statues-of-pm-yogi-guard-a-rooftop-temple-against-demolition-in-bharuch-9135684/,127,Right-leaning,0.042,0.091,0.867,-0.978
"IRS officer, who demanded dismissal of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suspended","Two days before he was set to retire, Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer B Balamurugan from Tamil Nadu, who had demanded the dismissal of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over an ED case, was suspended by the Union Ministry of Finance on Monday.
As per reports, Balamurugan was scheduled to retire on Wednesday.
Balamurugan, who served as Deputy Commissioner of GST and CEx, Chennai (North), wrote to President Droupadi Murmu earlier in January seeking the dismissal of Union Minister Sitharaman for ‚Äòconverting the ED into an extended arm of BJP‚Äô. The officer had written to President Murmu over the July 2023 Enforcement Directorate summons to two Dalit farmers in Tamil Nadu‚Äôs Salem district in a case of alleged money laundering.
Balamurugan‚Äôs wife, Dalit G Pravina, was the lawyer of the farmers in the ED case, which has been closed now.
The suspension order issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and dated January 29, which indianexpress.com has seen, did not cite any other reason for suspending Balamurugan.
The suspension order also said that disciplinary proceedings are being contemplated against Balamurugan. It added that the suspended official should not leave the headquarters without obtaining prior permission from the competent authority.
While speaking to local media on Tuesday, Balamurugan said he was suspended because he wrote to President Murmu demanding the removal of Nirmala Sitharaman.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/irs-officer-nirmala-sitharaman-suspended-9136269/,128,Right-leaning,0.017,0.074,0.909,-0.9897
Masih as ‚ÄòBJP messiah‚Äô: Meet presiding officer at centre of Chandigarh mayoral tussle,"Presiding officer Anil Masih was at the centre of the drama that unfolded in the Chandigarh mayoral elections on Tuesday. The BJP‚Äôs Manoj Sonkar won the close election after 8 votes of the parties on the other side were declared invalid by Masih, prompting the AAP and the Congress, who were contesting together as INDIA bloc partners, to accuse him of tampering with the result.
Earlier on January 18, when the elections were originally slated, Masih had suddenly fallen ill, leading to the polls being postponed to January 30. The municipal secretary, Gurinder Sodhi, too had taken leave two days before the January 18 polls allegedly due to back pain.

The Congress and AAP have accused Masih of scribbling on the ballot papers to render them invalid.
Masih joined the BJP in 2018 and is an active member of the party‚Äôs minority wing. He is currently among the nine nominated councillors (they do not have voting rights) in the general house of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.

He was nominated in 2022 apparently as a face to represent the issues of minorities in the House.
Sources within the BJP said that Masih, who was close to former BJP president Arun Sood, was one of the contenders for the BJP ticket during the Chandigarh civic polls in December 2021 from Ward No. 13.
However, almost after a year, Masih was selected as the nominated councillor in 2022.Advertisement

As recently as January 10, Masih was seen sharing the stage as AAP councillor Lakhbir Singh joined the BJP. This too had provoked reactions from the Opposition.

"Decode politics: Tribals key, how Naveen govt doing damage control over law, unveiling promises in Odisha","Three months after it decided to amend a 67-year-old regulation to allow the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals in scheduled areas, the Odisha government on Monday decided to withdraw the decision that had run into controversy.
The reversal by the government seemed to have been driven by apprehensions of a tribal backlash ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state.
What is the law in question? 
The Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (By Scheduled Tribes) Regulation, 1956, allows the transfer of tribal land only to other members of the tribal community. ‚ÄúAny transfer of immovable property by a member of a Scheduled Tribe, except by way of mortgage executed in favour of any public financial institution for securing a loan granted by such institution for any agricultural purpose, shall be absolutely null and void‚Ä¶ unless such transfer is made in favour of another member of a Scheduled Tribe,‚Äù the law, last amended in 2002, states.
The law also prohibits the sale of land held by tribals if it means the remaining landholding held by them falls to less than 2 acres in case of irrigated land and 5 acres in case of non-irrigated land.

What did the now-withdrawn amendment propose?
The amendment to Regulation 2 of the Act allowed the sale of lands held by tribals to non-tribals and also allowed them to mortgage lands with public financial institutions for non-agricultural purposes.
What forced the government‚Äôs hand?
Protests broke out following the announcement, leading to the state government announcing on November 17 last year that it had decided to withhold the proposal. The announcement was made by Odisha Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Sudam Marndi, who had hailed the decision earlier, without elaborating.Advertisement
Opposition parties, which led the protests, called the amendment ‚Äúa conspiracy against the tribals‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe feel the amendment was made to legalise benami property transactions by land mafia in tribal areas,‚Äù BJP MLA Nityananda Gond said.

A senior official, requesting anonymity, admitted the government feared that the tribals could take the wrong message from the amnendment. ‚ÄúThe Opposition tried to provoke tribals with ill-intention. The government had taken the decision for the benefit of tribals following recommendations of the Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC). It later realised that the decision may hamper its tribal support base,‚Äù it said.
How important are tribals in Odisha politics?
Tribals comprise 22.85% of the state‚Äôs population. Thirty-three of the 147 Assembly constituencies and 5 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats are reserved for them. In 2019, the BJD and BJP had each won 2 of the reserved Lok Sabha tribal seats, while 1 was bagged by the Congress.Advertisement
In the simultaneous Assembly polls, the BJD and BJP bagged 18 and 11 tribal seats respectively while Congress got only 2. One each had gone to the CPI(M) and an Independent.
The state is home to 62 tribes, including 13 particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). There are 21 tribal languages and 74 identified dialects.
How has the Naveen Patnaik government been trying to ensure tribal support?
Apart from withdrawing the amendment, the Odisha Cabinet recently approved a Rs 100 crore scheme ‚Äî ‚ÄòLaghu Bana Jatya Drabya Kraya‚Äô or ‚ÄòLABHA‚Äô ‚Äî under which the state government will procure minor forest produce at Minimum Support Price (MSP) from 14 tribal-dominated districts.
Chief Secretary P K Jena said the scheme would be fully sponsored by the state. ‚ÄúThe Tribal Development Cooperative Corporation of Odisha Ltd, a state-owned agency, will procure the produce on behalf of the state government through Mission Shakti. It will benefit more than 30,000 primary collectors, 1,000 self-help groups in 119 blocks of 14 districts,‚Äù he said.Advertisement
Sources claimed the government came up with LABHA as a similar Central government scheme had seen no release of funds over the past 10 years beyond the initial revolving funds.
The Cabinet has also approved the constitution of a Commission, with a rank of Cabinet minister, to ‚Äúpreserve and protect‚Äù tribal languages and dialects. ‚ÄúThe commission will also help tribal children get education in their mother tongue apart from other languages at school-level. It will enable the government to set up a database to document and preserve endangered tribal languages and promote the use of indigenous languages in official communication to protect the linguistic diversity,‚Äù state SC/ST Development Secretary Roopa Roshan Sahoo said.Advertisement
In May last year, the government had set up special development councils (SDCs) in 14 tribal-dominated districts taking the number of districts having the body to 23. The SDCs, initially formed in September 2017 districts in nine districts with a tribal population of more than 50%, work to conserve tribal culture, traditions and indigenous lifestyles. With an expenditure of Rs 223 crore on SDCs, the government claims that the move has benefited 80 lakh tribals.
Besides, the Odisha Cabinet has given a nod to the government sending another proposal to the Centre urging it to include 169 communities in the ST list of Odisha.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/decode-politics-tribals-naveen-patnaik-odisha-9136590/,130,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.094,0.049,0.858,0.983
Today in Politics: All eyes on Modi govt 2.0‚Äôs last Budget; suspense over Jharkhand Governor‚Äôs move on new CM,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present on Thursday the Narendra Modi government 2.0‚Äôs last Budget before the Lok Sabha elections, which are round the corner.
This will be Sitharaman‚Äôs sixth consecutive Budget, although this time it will be an interim Budget also referred to as a vote on account as it seeks Parliament‚Äôs nod for a grant in advance to meet the central government‚Äôs essential expenditure for the first four months of the new fiscal year beginning April. A new government elected after the Lok Sabha polls will present the full Budget in July.
Sitharaman‚Äôs Budget speech is likely to showcase the achievements of the Modi government not just over the past year but also over the past decade. 
The Budget is likely to contain a mix of measures for the economy and electorally significant sections like farmers and women.
While the BJP does not face any pressure for populist measures, given its dominance in the heartland as evidenced by its resounding victory in recent Assembly elections in three states, Sitharaman is expected to stick to being fiscally prudent while sprinkling sops on sectors like agriculture and engines of the economy that would create jobs and boost consumption. The Budget is expected to focus on infrastructure.
While going by the precedence no major policy announcements are made in a vote on accounts, it has not stopped the incumbent government from making big announcements, like the cash dole for farmers announced in the 2019 interim Budget. The Modi government had then introduced the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to provide financial support of Rs 6,000 a year for farmers with less than two hectares of land and also proposed a mega pension scheme for those in the unorganised sector. 
The Budget would, however, provide an occasion to assess the fiscal health of the economy. It would provide a platform for the government to give a clear roadmap for achieving the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) targets.Advertisement
The budgeted fiscal deficit of 5.9% of the GDP for the current fiscal is likely to be achieved, but it is nearly twice the FRBM fiscal deficit to the GDP target of 3% for the central government. Correspondingly, the debt-GDP ratio at 54% is also well above the target of 40%.
The Budget Session of Parliament got underway Wednesday with President Droupadi Murmu addressing a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. President Murmu highlighted key achievements of the Modi government during the last 10 years and outlined the major policy priorities of the government in her last address before the nation heads into the general elections.
JMM leader Champai Soren‚Äôs govt-formation claim 
Jharkhand has plunged into a political crisis</strong> as the state‚Äôs new Chief Minister was not sworn in hours after the incumbent CM and JMM leader Hemant Soren resigned before being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday night.Advertisement
Accompanied by JMM leader and Transport Minister Champai Soren and several leaders of the JMM-led ruling coalition, Hemant Soren, tendered his resignation to Governor CP Radhakrishnan at the Raj Bhavan in Ranchi, which was accepted by the Governor. At the same time, 
Champai Soren, who was elected as the new leader of the JMM Legislature Party as well as the alliance, staked claim to form the new government with the support of the 47 MLAs in the 81-member House.  
‚ÄúWe have staked a claim to form the new government with the support of 47 MLAs,‚Äù Champai Soren told reporters Wednesday night.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Alamgir Alam, who also accompanied the ruling alliance‚Äôs delegation to the Raj Bhavan, said, ‚ÄúWe have handed over a support letter from 43 MLAs to the Governor who has assured to call us‚Äù.
The Governor told the incumbent alliance that he will revert on their proposal after considering the legalities. However, as Abhishek Angad reports, the Governor‚Äôs stance not to move quickly to fill the constitutional vacuum in the state triggered concerns in the JMM-led coalition of the JMM, Congress and RJD, whose tally of MLAs are 29, 17, and 1, respectively. In the Opposition camp, the BJP has 26 MLAs and the AJSU three. The CPI(M-L) and NCP (AP) have one MLA each while there are two Independents.Advertisement
Earlier, after more than seven hours of questioning by the ED in an alleged land scam case, Hemant resigned as the CM. He was subsequently arrested by the central agency.
Late Wednesday night, Hemant also filed a writ petition in the Jharkhand High Court against his arrest, which will hear the matter Thursday morning. The ED would also produce Hemant before a special PMLA court in Ranchi and is expected to seek his remand for custodial interrogation.Advertisement
Speculation about Hemant‚Äôs arrest was rife since around 5.30 pm Wednesday, when two mini-buses were seen going to his residence. Half an hour later, Chief Secretary L Khyangate and DGP Ajay Kumar Singh also arrived at his house.
The development capped days of political drama involving Hemant and the ED ‚Äî from the ED searching his Delhi residence Monday to the BJP claiming his ‚Äúdisappearance for 40 hours‚Äù to the JMM hitting back at the BJP dispensation and the central agencies.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will continue to make its way through West Bengal Thursday.

"An arrest long in the making, Hemant Soren under central agencies‚Äô scanner since 2020","Bringing an end to a long-drawn-out drama, senior JMM leader Hemant Soren was arrested on Wednesday night, soon after he had stepped down as Chief Minister. Before he resigned, he had spent the day being questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case.
Soren‚Äôs arrest came after he had skipped eight of 10 ED summons, the last being on Monday, when he allegedly ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù before officials reached his Delhi residence for questioning in the ED investigation into a ‚Äúhuge racket of illegal change of ownership of land by the mafia‚Äù in Jharkhand.
While dogged by investigations by Central agencies in several cases, Soren has insisted these are part of a political conspiracy to destabilise his Jharkhand government. For the JMM, the script is painfully familiar as Soren‚Äôs father, JMM founder-patriarch and three-time CM Shibu Soren‚Äôs political career remains tainted with a similar corruption allegation.

A trained engineer, Soren had followed his family into politics and fought his first election in 2005 from the Dumka Assembly seat, but lost. Four years later, he found himself among the senior JMM leadership following the sudden death of his elder brother Durga, who was considered the natural inheritor of Shibu‚Äôs political legacy.
Between 2009 and 2010, Soren had a brief stint as Rajya Sabha MP. He also served as the deputy chief minister when Arjun Munda headed a coalition of the BJP-JMM-JD(U)-AJSU later that year.
In 2013, Soren became the state‚Äôs youngest CM, but his tenure was short-lived. In the 2014 Assembly polls, the JMM lost out to the BJP, leaving Soren as the Leader of the Opposition. The JMM also received a drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
Soren finally made his comeback in the end-2019 Assembly polls, leading an Opposition coalition to a win against the BJP, and himself winning from two seats, Dumka and Barhait. The JMM-Congress-RJD combine won 47 seats and Soren became the CM for the second time.Advertisement

However, almost from the start, Soren has been battling an image problem amid growing perception of rising corruption during his tenure as CM. In September 2020, the Lokpal of India directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into a complaint of disproportionate assets against Shibu Soren and his family members.
In 2021, former BJP CM Raghubar Das released documents showing Soren had acquired a mining lease in his name while holding the mining and environment portfolio. The Jharkhand High Court issued a notice to Soren, calling it a ‚Äúserious matter‚Äù, and the BJP submitted a memorandum to then Governor Ramesh Bais, seeking the CM‚Äôs disqualification.
The Election Commission (EC) later wrote to the Chief Secretary, seeking documents on the lease so that it could formulate an opinion under Article 192 of the Constitution, which deals with the disqualification of legislators.Advertisement

It is widely believed that the EC recommended Soren‚Äôs disqualification. The EC had sent its opinion in a closed envelope in August 2022, however, it was never made public. Insiders had argued that the issue was at best immoral, not illegal.
Later, the Supreme Court struck down the PIL pertaining to Soren owning the mining lease filed in Jharkhand High Court stating that when the EC was looking into it, entertaining the PIL was a waste of time.
However, despite repeated demands by the CM and his party, as well as by other parties in the state, the Governor declined to make the EC‚Äôs opinion public or to act on it.
During a hearing, Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan told the High Court that the state government admitted it had committed ‚Äúa mistake‚Äù and the lease had since been surrendered.

In September 2022, at a special session of the Assembly, Soren won a trust vote with the BJP and AJSU boycotting proceedings. Soren gave a speech accusing the BJP of trying to bring down his government, and attacked the Governor for not coming clean on the EC‚Äôs recommendation.Advertisement
Over the course of 2023, the ED continued to summon Soren though the former CM skipped each one.
In response to an ED summons in August last year, Soren wrote to the agency that it was ‚Äúdeliberate and part of the design to besmirch his reputation‚Äù. He added that Central agencies had been targeting him for over a year only because he was not aligned with the political party in power at the Centre.Advertisement
In response to a summons in December, Soren discreetly sent a letter to the ED stating that in the CBI‚Äôs preliminary inquiry ‚Äì based on the complaint with the Lokpal ‚Äì all his and his family‚Äôs assets had been disclosed. ‚ÄúIssuance of repeated summons is actually malice and part of a political conspiracy to destabilise a democratically elected government. The undersigned shall readily provide any information or documents which you may bona fide require and which are not already available with you, provided you are entitled to seek the same in accordance with law,‚Äù Soren wrote.
Last December, Jharkhand Governor C P Radhakrishnan had sparked off a fresh controversy when in response to a query from The Indian Express on the EC sealed report containing its opinion on Soren owning a mining lease, and whether or not it will be made public, Radhakrishnan said, ‚ÄúI am repeatedly telling you, those who have done something wrong, those who are found guilty, have to face the consequences.

"Day 1 in new Parliament building: Excitement, tablets and a dose of protest over a mic that fell silent","Splash of excitement, a bit of confusion, some chanting that was gently brought down and complaints over a mic that fell silent. In a nutshell, it was more than business as usual for the MPs on the first day in the new Parliament building on Tuesday.
As they walked into the new Lok Sabha, many MPs were seen checking out the seats and tech devices placed in front of them. Some were more interested in the Sengol installed in the House, and the big screens on both sides of Speaker Om Birla‚Äôs chair. Some of the MPs found other talking points: the green carpets with peacock motifs and the huge windows near the ceiling embossed with the national bird.
Before the House met officially, many of the MPs from the ruling as well as the opposition sides were seen clicking pictures, with the younger members helping the seniors in getting the right angle and light shade.
See pictures | MPs walk from old Parliament building to new: A transition in photos
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was the most sought after as his party MPs patiently waited for their turn to be clicked with him. Rahul, who largely wore a serious look, then took his seat and engaged in a conversation with party colleague Kodikkunnil Suresh, who was seen explaining something animatedly.
Sonia Gandhi, who was seated in the first row for the Central Hall function earlier in the day, was not present.
The Congress members were amused to see two of their party colleagues from the Rajya Sabha ‚Äì Rajiv Shukla and Rajni Patil ‚Äì inside the Lok Sabha chamber. Finding themselves in the wrong chamber, both exited quickly.
Among those in the visitors‚Äô gallery was actor Kangana Ranaut, who was present to witness the introduction of the women‚Äôs Bill.Advertisement
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered the Lok Sabha with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and other ministers, the BJP MPs gave him a loud welcome by thumping desks, much to the discomfort of the opposition members. Soon came chants of ‚ÄúModi, Modi‚Äù from the women seated in the visitors‚Äô gallery.
The opposition MPs sprang from their seats, asking ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat is happening‚Äù, pointing towards the gallery.
The Prime Minister was seen giving directions to his ministers to calm down the visitors. Shah called both Gajendra Shekhawat and Anurag Thakur to see to it that the visiting women sat there quietly.Advertisement
As the Prime Minister announced the women‚Äôs Bill, it brought jubilation in the treasury benches. But the House did not miss the usual slogan shouting and protests. Shah and other ministers objected to Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury‚Äôs remark that the Bill, which was passed by Rajya Sabha in 2010, still stands. As the ministers protested, backbenchers from the Congress side were heard shouting: ‚ÄúSit there and listen to him.‚Äù
Shah argued that what Chowdhury said was factually wrong as the Bill, moved to Lok Sabha for consideration and passing after being cleared by the Rajya Sabha, lapsed with the dissolution of 15th Lok Sabha. Chowdhury tried to explain, but his mic fell silent, leading to protests from his party MPs.
The Congress MPs rushed towards the centre of the House, shouting slogans such as ‚ÄúNahi chalega, tanashahi nahi chalega‚Äù. They returned to their seats only after Speaker Birla directed the staff to ensure that the mic was switched on.
But the House plunged into pandemonium again when Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal stood up to introduce the Bill. The opposition members complained that they have not been handed copies of the Bill.
‚ÄúWhere is the Bill?‚Äù shouted AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi and others joined him. Amid the chaos, the Speaker said a digital copy of the 128th Amendment Bill was uploaded on the member‚Äôs portal in advance and they can access it on the tablet placed before them.Advertisement
However, many MPs could not figure out how to open the portal. As Owaisi continued to argue that he did not get it, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey came running to his seat to show how to access the portal. Dubey then went on to help other senior leaders, including Home Minister Shah, NCP leader Supriya Sule, TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee and DMK‚Äôs T R Baalu.
While the younger MPs figured out how to operate the tablet, many senior MPs were seen fiddling with the screen. SP MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq received a walk-through from NC leader Hasnain Masoodi on how to use it.Advertisement
Once the House was adjourned, the BJP MPs praised both the magnificence of the new building. But the opposition MPs were heard complaining about the ‚Äúlack of warmth and the absence of open space‚Äù in the new building.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/day-1-new-parliament-building-protests-excitement-tablets-8947744/,133,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.078,0.082,0.84,0.5245

Soon after the rally, Gandhi wrote in a post on X, ‚ÄúWe had clearly told Nitish ji that you will have to conduct caste census, we will not give you any relaxation on this.

"2023‚Äôs major political events, in numbers","With 2023 coming to a close and the stage set for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, here are some of the major political developments over the past year.
New Parliament, new record for MP suspensions
On May 28, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the new Parliament building, with an expanded capacity of 888 seats (from 543) in the Lok Sabha chamber. The Rajya Sabha chamber was also expanded to 384 seats from the previous 250 capacity. The construction cost an estimated Rs 1,200 crore, though the exact figure has not been released.
However, the inauguration was boycotted by 20 Opposition parties accounting for 242 MPs in both Houses over the PM inaugurating the Parliament and ‚Äúsidelining‚Äù President Droupadi Murmu, the constitutional head of the State.
But as far as Parliament working goes, it remained a tumultuous year, beginning with the disruption-ridden Budget Session that saw the second lowest time spent functioning for this government. The following two regular Sessions of Parliament also suffered in terms of productivity, though the Monsoon and Winter Sessions saw among the most Bills passed since 2019. But each Session was marred by disruptions and many crucial, and contentious, Bills passed with little to no discussion.
Pulling a pre-Assembly poll surprise, the government held a Special Session in September, where it introduced the women‚Äôs reservation Bill, which sought to allocate 33% of the seats in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies for women. The Bill was passed by both Houses in this session.

Among the other notable legislation passed this year was the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Bill, laying down how members of the poll agency were to be appointed ‚Äì now, the Selection Committee will consist of the PM, a Union Cabinet Minister, and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha.
Among the last Bills passed this year were the three criminal law Bills, which seek to overhaul the existing Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act.Advertisement
Opinion | 141 MPs suspended: Colonial hangover in New Parliament
The Winter Session, the penultimate Session of this government before the next general elections, was the most eventful. On December 13, the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament attack, two intruders jumped into the Lok Sabha and set off canisters emitting coloured gas.
Though no MPs were harmed and the intruders were apprehended, the Opposition‚Äôs protests and demand for Union Minister Amit Shah to deliver a statement on the security breach led to 146 MPs across both Houses getting suspended ‚Äì a record high for suspensions in Parliament‚Äôs history. The Session also saw outspoken Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra getting expelled over cash-for-query allegations by the Privileges Committee.

In March, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi was disqualified from the Lok Sabha after he was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison in a defamation case for remarks made in 2019 on the Modi surname. In August though, the Supreme Court stayed his suspension and he was reinstated to the House.Advertisement
In the Monsoon Session, the Modi government faced a no-confidence motion over the PM‚Äôs silence on the ethnic clashes in Manipur. The motion was easily defeated, though Modi, in a two-hour speech, spoke briefly about Manipur. It was the second no-trust vote faced by the Modi government, after a previous one in 2018.
Nine states went to polls
Nine states held Assembly elections this year, with the government changing hands in five. While the BJP won in four states, the Congress won in two, with regional parties taking the remaining three.

In the first Assembly polls of the year, in Tripura, the BJP just about managed a majority with 32 seats. The Opposition bloc won just 14 seats, with the CPI(M) winning 11 and the Congress winning three. The TIPRA Motha, a tribal outfit that was contesting its first Assembly election, emerged as the main Opposition party.
In Meghalaya, the National People‚Äôs Party (NPP) came to power in an alliance including the BJP and United Democratic Party (UDP), which had a combined seat tally of 46 in the 60-member House. The Congress was reduced to 5 seats, from 21 in 2018.
In Nagaland, the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) won 25 seats, with North-East Democratic Alliance partner BJP winning 12 in the 60-member House. The Congress though failed to win a single seat.Advertisement
Karnataka was the Congress‚Äôs best electoral outcome this year ‚Äì it recorded a comfortable win with 135 seats, ousting the BJP from its only southern state. Its campaign was built around a series of ‚Äúguarantees‚Äù, which went on to become the model for the remaining state elections in 2023. The BJP won 66 seats and the Janata Dal (Secular) won 19; the two parties would go on to form an alliance later in the year for the Lok Sabha elections.
Five states went to polls at the end of the year in the last round of state elections before the Lok Sabha polls. The results turned out to be a disappointment for the Congress, which was hoping to consolidate its position in the states ahead of seat-sharing talks with the INDIA bloc. It lost power in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh but managed to oust the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in Telangana. For the BJP though, the year ended on a positive note with wins in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and surprises in its new CMs faces in each of these states. In Mizoram, newcomer Zoram People‚Äôs Movement (ZPM) ended 36 years of a Congress-Mizo National Front (MNF) duopoly.Advertisement
A key election-related development was the establishment of a panel headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind to explore holding simultaneous national and state elections as part of the Centre‚Äôs push for ‚Äúone nation, one election‚Äù.
It was a notable year for the Election Commission too. Of the last 11 state elections, voter turnout increased in 7 states, as reported by PTI. On an aggregate basis, the voting percentage in 11 states was 73.41%. In a first since Independence, polling stations in 126 Naxal-affected villages, where turnout was 72%, were set up in Chhattisgarh. The EC also registered an additional 22 lakh first-time voters.Advertisement
The poll agency‚Äôs seizures saw a 10-fold increase from the previous elections as the EC made a fresh push to curtail the use of money to induce the voters. Enforcement agencies made record seizures of over Rs 3,000 crore in the past 11 Assembly elections.
NDA vs INDIA: Their numbers and their conflicts
On July 18, 26 parties came together under the banner of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, with the goal of creating a nationwide Opposition bloc against the BJP for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. But the INDIA bloc, led by the Congress, has suffered from several instances of infighting and poor coordination.
With just months to go for the general elections and after the Congress‚Äôs defeats in the November-December state polls, there has been little progress on seat-sharing negotiations, with regional parties hoping the Congress will compromise. In many states, members of the bloc are in direct contest, including in states like West Bengal and Kerala, further complicating seat-sharing talks.
In terms of legislative strength, the INDIA bloc has 142 MPs in the Lok Sabha, 98 MPs in the Rajya Sabha, and 1,637 MLAs and 120 MLCs across states. This leaves it facing an uphill task against the BJP-led NDA, which has 323 LS MPs, 109 Rajya Sabha MPs, and 1,834 MLAs and 177 MLCs.

Over the course of the year, the Opposition and the Centre clashed over several issues.
One such conflict was the India versus Bharat issue. Ahead of the G20 Summit in Delhi, the government sent out invitations for a dinner hosted by the President of ‚ÄúBharat‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù, sparking speculation that the BJP may officially change the country‚Äôs name. Though Article 1 of the Constitution uses the two names interchangeably, the Opposition alleged the change was the result of the formation of the INDIA bloc.
The two blocs also clashed after remarks from Udhayanidhi Stalin, son of Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin and a state minister in the DMK government, saying ‚ÄòSanatan Dharma‚Äô should be ‚Äúeradicated‚Äù. Union Home Minister Amit Shah lashed out at the INDIA bloc for ‚Äúinsulting this country‚Äôs culture, history and Sanatan Dharma‚Äù. Udhayanidhi stood firm on his comments and INDIA bloc partner CPI was among those to side with him. But the Congress and the TMC, for instance, distanced themselves from the remarks.
One issue that may play a role in the Lok Sabha elections is the caste census. While some members of the Opposition have been calling for a nationwide caste census since the first half of the year, the debate really kicked off in October, when the Bihar government released a caste survey, putting the Backward Classes population at 63% of the total.

As Opposition parties chase the OBC vote, which has largely been cornered by the BJP, the saffron party has remained lukewarm on the issue. The BJP government at the Centre is wary that a caste census could give rise to contesting demands as well as arouse other dormant quota calls, shattering its delicate caste balancing.
The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, meanwhile has been raising the ‚ÄòJitni aabadi, utna haq (rights according to numerical strength)‚Äô slogan in an attempt to add OBC support to its minority vote consolidation. But the calls for a caste census do not appear to have resonated among voters in the recently concluded Assembly polls. Several other states have since announced plans to conduct their own caste surveys.
Manipur violence: 7 months, 175 deaths
Since May 3, Manipur has been ravaged by ethnic violence between the Kukis, a tribal group who are largely Christian, and the dominant Meiteis, who are mostly Hindu.
The conflict began over the Meiteis demand for tribal status, which the Kukis opposed over fears that it would further increase their influence in government and society, and allow them to buy land in Kuki-dominated regions and get a share of jobs reserved for Kukis.
Meiteis make up about half the state‚Äôs population and hold 40 of the 60 seats in the Assembly. CM N Biren Singh is a Meitei. While the Meiteis are concentrated in the Imphal valley, the Kukis reside in the less-developed surrounding hills.
As per the latest figures from the Manipur Police, the state has seen 175 deaths, 1,118 injuries and 32 cases of missing persons. At least 60,000 people have been left homeless. There were also 5,132 cases of arson, within which 4,786 houses had been burnt and 386 religious structures had been vandalised. During the violence, over 4,000 arms were looted from state armouries, of which 1,329 were recovered, along with 15,050 ammunition and 400 bombs.
Though the violence has eased in recent months, life has remained disrupted in Manipur. Schools and colleges have been unable to operate normally, transportation and communication networks have been hit, hurting agricultural and other economic activity.
Four years on, Supreme Court upholds Article 370 abrogation
In a year of milestones, the Supreme Court delivered a melange of seminal verdicts in 2023 including those that upheld the Centre‚Äôs decisions to scrap Article 370, which bestowed special status on Jammu and Kashmir, and the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes.
Under Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, the top court created a record by disposing of 52,191 cases between January 1 and December 15, 2023. It had disposed of nearly 40,000 cases the previous year.
To round off the year, on December 11, the Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370, more than four years after it was scrapped. But the apex court ordered the government to reinstate J&K statehood and hold Assembly elections by September 2024. Since the abrogation of Article 370, which split the state into two Union Territories, the region has been under President‚Äôs Rule and has held only two local body elections.
The region has not had an Assembly since it was dissolved in 2018, with the last state polls taking place in 2016.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/2023-major-political-events-in-numbers-9086049/,137,Right-leaning,0.057,0.074,0.869,-0.6472
"Congress says BJP workers attacked Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, security forces escort Rahul Gandhi | Watch","Congress leaders said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was attacked by BJP workers as it passed through Assam on Sunday. The vehicle of senior party MP Jairam Jamesh was allegedly attacked while media officials covering the event were ""manhandled"" by miscreants in Assam's Sonitpur district. The incident took place as the Rahul Gandhi-led Yatra travelled from Biswanth district to Nagaon on its fourth day in the northeastern state. 







    ‚ÄúMy vehicle was attacked a few minutes ago at Jumugurihat, Sunitpur by an unruly BJP crowd who also tore off the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra stickers from the windshield. They threw water and shouted anti-BJNY slogans. But we kept our composure, waved to the hooligans and sped away. This is undoubtedly the Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's doing. We are not intimidated and will soldier on,"" asserted Jairam Ramesh. 




   Visuals shared online showed Congress MP Rahul Gandhi being escorted into the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra bus by security personnel amid the ruckus. The Wayanad lawmaker had moved towards a large crowd of people which included people holding BJP flags.    




   ‚Äú20-25 BJP workers carrying sticks came in front of our bus, and when I came out from the bus, they ran away...they think that Congress is scared of BJP and RSS, they're dreaming. They can tear as many posters and placards as they want, we don't care. we are not scared of anybody, we are neither scared of PM Narendra Modi nor Assam CM,"" added Gandhi.    The Congress MP had earlier accused the BJP-led Assam government of refusing permissions for programmes along the yatra route and threatening people against joining the event.¬†    All India Congress Committee (AICC) communications coordinator Mahima Singh told PTI that those covering the event had also been affected. The party official said that the media personnel had exited their vehicles to get visuals of a BJP program happening in the area.    ‚ÄúThe camera, badge and other apparatus of a vlogger who has been covering the Yatra were snatched. Members of the social media team of the party were also manhandled‚Ä¶They created a very intimidating situation for us. They have refused to return the camera of the vlogger, claiming that it was not snatched,"" she added,"" she said.    The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is scheduled to travel through Assam till January 25, covering a total of 833 km across 17 districts.    (With inputs from agencies)

"Arvind Kejriwal summoned by ED for 4th time; Delhi CM calls it ‚Äòinvalid, illegal‚Ä¶‚Äô","Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the fourth time, called it ‚Äòillegal and invalid‚Äô. Kejriwal has been asked to appear before the ED on Thursday or Friday. 







    Commenting on it, Kejriwal said, ‚ÄúED sent me the fourth notice today and asked me to appear before them on either on 18th or 19th January. These four notices are illegal and invalid. Whenever ED sends such notices, they are quashed by the court."" 




   ‚ÄúThese notices are nothing but just political vendetta. An investigation has been done in this case for 2 years but they did not recover anything. Why have I been called 2 months before the Lok Sabha elections?""        The Aam Aadmi Party alleged that the BJP wants Kejriwal to be arrested so that he cannot campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.    ""This is being done to stop him from campaigning for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. ED has said that Kejriwal is not an accused, then why were the summons issued to him,"" the party said.    ¬†




   Earlier, the chief minister was asked to appear on November 2 and December 21, 2023, but skipped the summons. The 55-year-old leader had refused to depose before the ED for the third time on January 3, citing Rajya Sabha polls and Republic Day preparations.  What are the charges against Kejriwal?Kejriwal's name has been mentioned multiple times in charge sheets filed by the ED in the case. The agency has said that the accused were in touch with him regarding the preparation of the now-scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.    The ED had claimed in its charge sheet that the AAP used ""proceeds of crime"" to the tune of about  ‚Çπ45 crore in its Goa election campaign.    The agency is expected to file a fresh supplementary charge sheet in the case and may name AAP as a ""beneficiary"" of the alleged kickbacks that were generated through the excise policy.    It is alleged that the Delhi government's excise policy for 2021-22 to grant licences to liquor traders allowed cartelisation and favoured certain dealers who had allegedly paid bribes for it, a charge repeatedly refuted by the AAP.    The policy was subsequently scrapped and Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena recommended a CBI probe, following which the ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

"‚ÄòTotally undemocratic thing‚Äô: Congress, AAP slam BJP over cancellation of Chandigarh mayoral polls","Congress and Aam Aadmi Party have lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the cancellation of mayor polls scheduled to be held in Chandigarh on Thursday. 







    The AAP and Congress accused the BJP of not allowing to hold the mayoral polls in the wake of its ""imminent defeat"" and also said that they would move the Punjab and Haryana High Court to hold the elections. 




   Anil Masih was nominated as the presiding authority for the mayoral elections.        ""I have got information that the presiding officer has been hospitalised with the intention to postpone the mayor election by the BJP. They have done a totally undemocratic thing,"" Congress leader Pawan Kumar said.    AAP MP Raghav Chadha said, ""It is clear that INDIA alliance is winning this election & BJP is losing. BJP has got scared of the INDIA alliance"".    He said if a presiding officer has fallen ill, then another presiding officer can be appointed to hold the polls.    Chadha said, ""We had valid passes for going to the MC office and then it was informed that entry was closed as the presiding officer had suddenly fallen sick.""    ""He is actually not sick. These are BJP's tactics and it shows that BJP can stoop to any level to end democracy and free and fair elections,"" the Rajya Sabha member alleged.    The development came just ahead of the polling for the posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor, and deputy mayor. The meeting for polling through secret ballot was to take place at 11 am in the assembly hall of the municipal corporation.    However, there was no official word on postponing the mayoral polls. No next date for the poll has been given, Congress said.    Several councillors received a message on an official WhatsApp group saying: ‚ÄúIt is informed that a telephonic message has been received regarding the ill health of Anil Masih, who has been nominated as presiding authority for the meeting scheduled on January 18 for the post of Mayor u/60 (a) read with Regulation 6 (1) of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (Procedure and Conduct of Business) Regulation, 1996. In view of the above, it is requested not to reach the MC office till further orders are received.""  'Chandigarh Mayor Polls'The Chandigarh Mayor polls hold significance as the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party -- both INDIA bloc members -- have joined hands to contest the elections to oust the BJP from the chair of mayor which it has been winning for the last eight years.    Chadha had said that the INDIA bloc will sweep the Chandigarh municipal polls and the victory will be the curtain raiser for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.    Under the Congress-AAP alliance, the latter will fight for the mayor's seat while the Congress will contest the posts of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.    In the 35-member Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the BJP has 14 councillors. It also has an ex-officio member MP (Kirron Kher) who has voting rights.    The AAP has 13 councillors and the Congress seven. The Shiromani Akali Dal has one councillor in the House.

Chhota Recharge of RSS: AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi criticises AAP... 'How are you different from the BJP?',"Over the last few days, Asaduddin Owaisi, chief of All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), expressed concerns about the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) political approach, stating that there is no difference between BJP-RSS and AAP. 







    In a recent interview with ANI, Owaisi accused AAP of hypocrisy, claiming that despite their claims of being distinct, AAP is essentially following the Hindutva line, similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He pointed out their varied statements about the Saryu River and the inclusion of Path in educational centres and hospitals. 




 Competitive Hindutva PoliticsThe AIMIM leader highlighted the current trend of competitive Hindutva politics, where parties are vying for the votes of the majority community. Owaisi urged Muslims in the country to take notice of this political shift and called on secular Hindu brothers to be vigilant.        Earlier, Owaisi referred to AAP as ""RSS ka chota recharge"" and questioned the timing of organizing Sundar Kand Path ahead of the Ram Temple inauguration in Ayodhya. He criticized the decision to conduct the recitation in every assembly constituency of Delhi on the first Tuesday of every month.    ""Chhota Recharge of RSS has decided that Sunderkand Path will be organized in every assembly constituency of Delhi on the first Tuesday of every month. This decision was taken because of the inauguration on January 22. Let me remind you that these people had maintained silence on the issue of Bilkis Bano and had said that they only wanted to talk about issues like education and health. Is Sunderkand lesson education or health? The real thing is that they are afraid of justice. Giving full support to the agenda of the Sangh. Let us not even talk about Babri, you keep playing the flute of justice, love, and so-and-so and at the same time keep strengthening Hindutva. Wow!"" he wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).




   Speaking to ANI on January 16, the leader again reiterated his stance, ‚ÄúWhen I saw that the Delhi CM and his government have decided that there will be Sunderkand Path and Hanuman Chalisa recitation every Tuesday, I tweeted this - how are you different from the BJP? There is no difference between BJP-RSS and you. Look at their hypocrisy...You are walking the path of Narendra Modi. You want to do what he is doing...The politics of competitive Hindutva is being adopted...""    Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on January 15 said that Sunder Kand would be recited in all Vidhan Sabha constituencies of Delhi on the first Tuesday of every month. He also announced the organization of Sunder Kand Path and Hanuman Chalisa at approximately 2,600 locations in the near future.  (With inputs from ANI)

"‚ÄòGreed, fear‚Äô: Congress reacts as Milind Deora is set to join BJP ally in Maharashtra","As Milind Deora submitted his resignation from the Congress, the Congress has alleged that the timing of the announcement of his departure from the party was determined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 







    ""Prime Minister has decided this, there is no doubt about it,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said. 




   While speaking to news agency ANI, Jairam Ramesh also remembered Milind's father, Murli Deora and highlighted his leadership and strong association with the Congress party.

   Jairam Ramesh also spoke with news agency PTI and said that Deora had spoken with him over phone this Friday and requested that he wanted to speak with Rahul Gandhi over his concerns over the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) laying claim to the South Mumbai Lok Sabha seat.    ‚ÄúHe messaged me on Friday at 8:52 AM and then at 2:47 PM I replied, ‚ÄòAre you planning a switch?‚Äô.

"Sena vs Sena: Uddhav Thackeray had no power to remove Eknath Shinde, says Maharashtra Speaker Rahul Narwekar","Dealing a severe blow to the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction, Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar on Wednesday ruled that the Eknath Shinde-led group is the real Shiv Sena in the Assembly and its MLAs cannot be disqualified. Former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had no power to remove Eknath Shinde following a mutiny in the Shiv Sena ranks, Narwekar stated.¬† 







    The Shiv Sena suffered a split in 2022 after a group of MLAs joined hands with the BJP to revolt against the party leadership. The move had led to the collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with both factions filing disqualification petitions against each other. 




   ‚ÄúShiv Sena constitution provides that the national executive is the highest body. Claims by Thackeray faction that the will of the paksh pramukh is the will of the party cannot be accepted. The constitution says that the paksha pramukh has no absolute power and they have to be exercised in consultation with the national executive,"" he asserted.        Narwekar said the UBT faction did not submit any material to prove that the national executive meeting was held to decide which faction was the real party following the split.¬†    ‚ÄúShinde faction was the real Shiv Sena political party when rival factions emerged on 21st June 2022,"" he added.  ALSO READ: Sena vs Sena: Maharashtra Speaker to issue disqualification plea verdict on Jan 10 | A quick recapThe Speaker said that the Uddhav Thackeray group‚Äôs submission to consider Shiv Sena 2018 constitution cannot be accepted. The Speaker instead relied on the 1999 constitution of the Shiv Sena ‚Äî given by the Eknath Shinde-led faction ‚Äî as the 'valid constitution'. A 2018 edition of the guidelines was deemed invalid as it does not feature on Election Commission records.    ‚ÄúThe constitution of Shiv Sena provided by ECI is the relevant constitution of Shiv Sena for the determination of which faction is the real political party,"" he said.




   ‚ÄúIn view of the evidence and records before me, prima facie indicates that no elections were held in the year 2013, as well as in the year 2018. However, I as the speaker exercising jurisdiction under the 10th schedule have limited jurisdiction and cannot go beyond the record of the ECI as available on the website and hence I have not considered this aspect while determining the relevant leadership structure. Thus, given the above conclusions, I find that the leadership structure of Shiv reflected in the letter dated 27th February 2018 available on the website of the ECI is the relevant leadership structure which has to be taken into account for the purpose of determining which faction is the real political party..."" he added.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/shiv-sena-maharashtra-speaker-rahul-narwekar-disqualification-of-mlas-uddhav-thackeray-eknath-shinde-11704887508306.html,146,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.106,0.047,0.846,0.9862
Shiv Sena split case: Maharashtra speaker to announce verdict on disqualification pleas today,"Maharashtra legislative Assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar is set to announce verdict on the disqualification petitions filed by the two warring Sena factions- Eknath Shinde faction, and Uddhav Thackeray faction. Narwekar is slated to deliver his much-awaited verdict on the disqualification pleas at 4 pm on Wednesday. 







    The political temperature rose in Maharashtra on Tuesday ahead of the crucial verdict by the assembly speaker on the cross-petitions by Shiv Sena factions seeking disqualification of each other's MLAs following a split in the party, an outcome which will decide the way forward for the Eknath Shinde government and also the regional outfit's rival groups. 




   In June 2022, Shinde and dozens of other Shiv Sena MLAs rebelled against then chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, leading to a split in the Sena and fall of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition government.        The disqualification petitions were filed by both Shinde and Thackeray factions against each other's legislators, seeking disqualification under the anti-defection law. Of 56 MLAs of the undivided Shiv Sena, 40 are with Shinde.    The Supreme Court had on 15 December 2023 extended the deadline for Narwekar to decide the disqualification petitions from 31 December to 10 January.    While extending the deadline for deciding the disqualification petitions till January 10, the Supreme Court had said the sanctity of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution should be maintained.    The top court had also asked the speaker to decide the NCP's petition seeking disqualification of nine MLAs of the Ajit Pawar group by January 31, 2024. In July last year, the Ajit Pawar faction of the NCP also joined the Shinde-led government.    Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) MLA Sunil Prabhu, who was the chief whip of the undivided Shiv Sena had filed the disqualification petitions against Eknath Shinde and other MLAs in 2022.    Later, a separate plea was filed by the Sharad Pawar faction of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for a direction to the speaker to expeditiously decide the disqualification petitions against deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and party MLAs loyal to him.    The 10th Schedule of the Constitution is designed to prevent defection of elected and nominated members of Parliament and state legislatures from political parties on whose ticket they win, and contains stringent provisions against it under which they can be disqualified.    The delay in deciding the disqualification petitions against Shinde and Shiv Sena MLAs loyal to him had come under strict scrutiny by the apex court which had come down hard on the assembly speaker at previous hearings, saying the proceedings cannot be reduced to a charade and that he cannot ""defeat"" its orders.    On Tuesday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde expressed confidence and said that numbers were stacked in favour of the Shiv Sena led by him.    Even the Election Commission has recognised that the majority of Shiv Sena lawmakers were with his faction, Shinde told reporters here. ""Numbers are important in democracy. We have a majority in the assembly and Lok Sabha,"" he said.    Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) of Uddhav Thackeray denounced in Supreme Court the ""highly improper"" meeting between Maharashtra CM Shinde and Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar, barely three days before the deadline set by the apex court for the latter to decide cross-petitions filed by rival Sena factions seeking disqualification of several of each other's MLAs.    According to news reports, Narwekar met Shinde at 'Varsha', the chief minister's official residence on January 7.    Assembly polls in Maharashtra are due in the second half of 2024.

SC refuses to quash criminal proceedings against Pawan Khera over remarks on PM Modi,"The Supreme Court has refused to quash criminal proceedings against Congress leader Pawan Khera over his remarks against PM Modi. A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta saidon Thursday that was not inclined to interfere with the Allahabad High Court order. The apex court had earlier clubbed three FIRs lodged against the senior Congress leader for making ‚Äòobjectionable remarks‚Äô against PM Narendra Modi. 







    ""Sorry, we are not inclined,"" the bench said on Thursday. 




   The senior politician had stoked outrage in February 2023 after referring to the Prime Minister as ‚ÄòNarendra Gautam Das Modi‚Äô. The remark ‚Äì seen as a reference to industrialist Gautam Adani ‚Äì had not gone down well with BJP leaders and supporters. The senior politician was arrested by the Assam Police soon after the incident and remains out on bail.        Khera faces charges under several sections of the IPC ‚Äî including 53A (promoting communal enmity), 153B (imputations prejudicial to national integration), 500 (defamation) and 504 (insult with intent to provoke breach of peace).¬†  ALSO READ: Congress renames Manipur-to-Maharashtra march, set to embark on Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from January 14The SC had clubbed FIRs filed against Khera in Assam and Uttar Pradesh while extending his interim bail in March. It had also transferred the matter to the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow.¬†    Khera has tendered an unconditional apology in the court for the alleged remarks.    The Allahabad HC had dismissed Khera's plea on the matter in mid-August last year. It said that the evidence collected by the investigating officer of the case could be evaluated in petition filed under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the case.

The assertion came from state Congress chief Rajesh Thakur after newly appointed JMM chief Champai Soren sought time from the governor to prove majority. Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Hemant Soren was produced before an PMLA Court in Ranchi on Thursday afternoon. 







    ""The JMM legislature party leader Champai Soren, who is leading the alliance, has sought time from the governor at 3 pm today to prove majority. We are unaware of the reasons for the delay...In case the Raj Bhawan delays in extending an invitation to the alliance to form a government, lawmakers will fly to Hyderabad, in a bid to thwart any attempt of the opposition BJP to poach them,"" Thakur told PTI. 




   A PTI report quoting sources indicates that two chartered planes ‚Äî one 12-seater and another of 37 seats ‚Äî have been booked for shifting the legislators. The ruling coalition claims to have the support of 47 MLAs.      ALSO READ: Jharkhand political crisis deepens as Governor delays appointment of next CMChief Minister Hemant Soren resigned on Wednesday night following his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in an money laundering case. The probe pertains to huge amounts of proceeds of crime generated by forging official records by showing 'fake sellers' and purchasers in the guise of forged or bogus documents to acquire huge parcels of land having value in crores.    The senior politician moved the Supreme Court challenging his arrest on Thursday morning. Hemant Soren has sought to declare his arrest and consequent detention ‚Äòunwarranted, arbitrary, illegal and violative of fundamental rights‚Äô.¬†    ‚ÄúNo evidence has been by them found yet. They also tried to spoil my image by conducting raids at my Delhi residence. We have to fight a new fight now against those who commit atrocities against the poor, Adivasis, Dalit and the innocent,"" he said in a video message recorded just before his arrest.

"No CAA in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu: Mamata Banerjee, MK Stalin vow not to allow citizenship law","On January 29, Union Minister Shantanu Thakur announced that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was set to be enforced nationwide within a week. His comments triggered responses from various leaders. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her Tamil Nadu counterpart, MK Stalin, have voiced strong opposition. 







  What Mamata Banerjee saidBanerjee has vehemently opposed the CAA and related policies like the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Uniform Civil Code. She claimed these as merely political tricks before the Lok Sabha Elections 2024. 




 Also Read: CAA final draft likely to be ready by March 30, 2024: Union Minister""They (BJP) are speaking about NRC, CAA and Uniform Civil Code ahead of the elections. This is nothing but politics. We have given citizenship to everyone (and) they (people in border areas) are getting everything. They are citizens, which is why they are allowed to vote,"" PTI quoted her as saying.        ""Let me make it very clear that, as long as I am alive, I will not allow NRC implementation in West Bengal. I will not allow them to take away the citizenship of anyone. Everyone here is a citizen,"" Banerjee added.  What MK Stalin saidMeanwhile, MK Stalin mirrored this resistance. The Tamil Nadu CM, who is presently on a foreign tour, has stated that the DMK government will block the CAA in the state. He criticised the act for discriminating against Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamil refugees.  Also Read: No one can stop CAA implementation': Amit Shah urges people to re-elect Modi, oust Mamata BanerjeeStalin has also condemned the AIADMK, Tamil Nadu's main Opposition, for supporting the CAA in Parliament. He emphasised the DMK's history of opposing the CAA, including protests and a signature campaign. Under his leadership, the state government urged the Central government to retract the CAA.    The people, according to him, are witnessing the Centre's actions that ""go against communal harmony"" and the AIADMK's ""drama"". Stalin said that the DMK government would never implement the controversial law.  What is CAA?The CAA is a law that aims to provide a faster pathway for Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from three neighbouring countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.  Also Read: Citizenship Amendment Act rules ready, set to be notified before Lok Sabha elections 2024The law focuses on helping those who arrived in India before December 31, 2014, and who have faced religious persecution in their home countries. Essentially, it's designed to help individuals from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have fled to India because of persecution based on their religion.

"Budget 2024 Highlights: Delhi Minister Atishi slams ‚Äòjumla‚Äô govt, questions promise of 55 lakh jobs","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday asserted that the BJP-led government at the Centre has worked with an approach to development that is ""all-round, all-inclusive and all-pervasive"" ('sarvangin', 'sarvasparshi' and 'sarvasamaveshi') and said that the trinity of ""Democracy, Demography and Diversity"" can help fulfil the aspirations of every Indian. 







    Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting her sixth Budget ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, said that the Indian economy has witnessed a profound positive transformation in the last 10 years. 




   ""The next five years will be the years of unprecedented development. Trinity of democracy, demography and diversity can help fulfil the aspirations of every Indian. The Indian economy has witnessed a profound positive transformation in the last 10 years, The people of India are looking ahead to the future with hope and optimism,"" the Finance Minister said in her budget speech.        Stating that her government's vision of development covers all castes and people at all levels, Sitharaman said the aim is to make India a 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed Bharat) by 2047.    ""As our Prime Minister firmly believes, we need to focus on four major castes, they are gareeb (poor), mahilayein (women), yuva (youth) and annadata (farmers). Their needs, their aspirations and their welfare are our highest priority,"" Finance Minister said while stating that the main focus of the Interim Budget stands on four pillars.    Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressed hope that the good policies and the work done by the Central government will help the BJP return to power for the third consecutive time in a row.    The Interim Budget 2024 was approved by Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the day.    Meanwhile, Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said, ""It is an important day.""    In his customary media briefing ahead of the Budget session, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government will ""follow tradition"" and the full Budget will be presented only after the formation of new government.  Here is how the opposition leaders are reacting to the interim budget:¬†  ‚ÄúThe budget proves that this is a 'jumla' government. PM Modi had said in 2014 that he would provide 2 crore jobs every year but not even one crore people got jobs. Today they have given a new 'jumla' that they will give 55 lakh jobs... No step has been taken to reduce the inflation‚Ä¶"" says Delhi Minister Atishi.‚ÄúThe youth, Dalit and the people of the backward class had hopes that the budget will talk about them...BJP will have to face great loss in the 2024 elections due to this budget..."" said AAP MP Sushil Kumar Rinku.‚ÄúThey are waiting for the next full Budget, which we will come and present. INDIA alliance will win and we will present the best budget after the net elections,"" says DMK MP T Siva.‚ÄúWhat's worrying is that there is a budget deficit of  ‚Çπ18 lakh crores. This means that the government is borrowing for its expenditure. This number is only going to increase next year,"" said Congress MP Manish Tewari.‚ÄúHuge difference between saying and doing"": Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi




 ‚ÄúThe Finance Minister's speech sounded like an election speech. The President's address was also used as political speech,"" said Congress leader Sachin Pilot.‚ÄúThis budget was hollow. There was nothing for the youth, women, farmers...I saw arrogance when they said that they would present the Budget in July. You cannot take any election for granted,"" said Shiromani Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal.On Interim Budget 2024-25, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP NK Premachandran says, ""Unfortunately, the finance minister is talking about the achievements of the last ten years. It is a temporary budget. Even then it is not giving any vision...The unemployment position in the country is alarming and nothing is mentioned about this...It is only an eloquent speech made by the finance minister...""",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/budget-2024-live-how-india-cong-is-reacting-to-nirmala-sitharamans-interim-budget-ahead-of-lok-sabha-polls-2023-11706765399836.html,151,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.089,0.046,0.866,0.9865
Former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren arrested by ED in land scam case,"JMM President Hemant Soren was arrested by the officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday in the land scam case. The arrest came after 7 hours of questioning at his residence in Ranchi, after which Hemant Soren decided to go to Raj Bhawan and resigned from his position as chief minister of Jharkhand. 







  Hemant Soren News Live: Champai Soren stakes claim to form government in JharkhandMeanwhile, the MLAs of the ruling JMM-Congress coalition also reached the Governor's house and declared senior JMM leader Champai Soren as the choice for the next chief minister of Jharkhand. 




   ‚ÄúHemant Soren has resigned from the post of CM...We have the support of 47 MLAs...We have proposed to form a new government. Champai Soren will be our new CM...We have not been given time for swearing in..."" Jharkhand MLA Alamgir Alam said.        The resignation of the chief minister and his subsequent arrest came after some high-voltage drama as earlier ED was supposed to question Hemant Soren in Delhi, but fearing his imminent arrest, the JMM leader decided to take a 1,200 km road trip to Ranchi.    At around 1:00 PM on Wednesday, the ED reached the residence of Hemant Soren in Ranchi for questioning in the land scam case. Ahead of the questioning of the federal agency, the JMM leader chaired the meeting of the MLAs of the ruling coalition, which intensified the speculations of his arrest.    After 7 hours of questioning, two mini-buses of JMM-Congress MLA reached Raj Bhawan, followed by Hemant Soren with the team of the Enforcement Directorate. The JMM leader tendered his resignation to the Jharkhand Governor, while the JMM-Congress coalition declared Champai Soren as the next chief minister.  Governor refuses to meet JMM-Congress MLAsThe developments in Jharkhand will be closely watched as things are changing every minute. Earlier, the Jharkhand Governor refused to meet JMM-Congress MLAs, who reached Raj Bhawan to formally announce Champai Soren as the leader of the House.    The MLAs expressed their frustration after coming out of Raj Bhawan and even questioned the intentions of the Governor.    ""We have proposed to form the government under the leadership of Champai Soren. We have 47 MLAs and we should be allowed to form the government... The Governor said that he will check our papers and call us..."" Alamgir Alam said.    ¬†

Why Nitish Kumar left INDIA bloc to rejoin BJP-led NDA,"In an unexpected turn of events, Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar quit as the Bihar Chief Minister on Sunday. He is now all set to form the state government in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners. 







    Kumar severed ties with Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD) on Sunday. He had formed the government in Bihar in alliance with the RJD and other Left parties in 2022.¬† 




 Follow Bihar politics LIVE Updates here        Nitish Kumar was also a key figure in the Opposition's INDIA bloc. His departure from INDIA is expected to impact the alliance of 28 Opposition parties just ahead of the Lok Sabha Elections 2024.    But what had prompted Nitish Kumar to leave the INDIA bloc and join the NDA, even when in 2023 he had reportedly said, ""Mar jaana qabool hai lekin unke (BJP) saath jaana humko kabhi qabool nahin hai (I'd rather die than tie up with them)"".    While informing about his resignation and decision to dissolve the Bihar Assembly, Nitish Kumar said on Sunday that this situation unfolded as ""not everything was alright"".




 Congress to be blamed?JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi blamed the Congress for the collapse of the INDIA bloc in Bihar. He told ANI that Congress leaders were interested in strengthening their party and not the opposition grouping.    Tyagi told reporters that a ""caucus"" within the Congress wanted to capture the INDIA bloc leadership. He even alleged that Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's name was proposed as the chairperson of the grouping as part of the conspiracy.  ALSO READ: What numbers in Bihar Assembly look like after Nitish Kumar switches alliance    ""The decision taken about Kharge at the INDIA bloc meeting earlier this month had shocked the JD(U), which believed that its president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar would be named as the convenor without being saddled with any chairperson,"" JD(U) leaders had then said as per news agency ANI.    Last month, Nitish Kumar rejected the post of INDIA convenor during a key meeting of the alliance partners. On Saturday, Tyagi had even accused a section of the Congress leadership of repeatedly ""insulting"" Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.    Besides, Tyagi also objected to Mallikarjun Kharge's name being proposed as INDIA's prime minister's face in the meeting that took place in Mumbai. This happened even as ""it was unanimously decided that INDIA will work without any PM face"", Tyagi said.    Another JD(U) spokesperson Rajib Ranjan described the Congress as ""bhasmasur"" (mythological demon whose touch would burn down anyone).  Delay in seat-sharing talksKV Tyagi said the Congress kept dragging the seat-sharing talks. ""...We kept saying that seat sharing needs to happen immediately...INDIA lacked plans to fight against the BJP"".",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/why-nitish-kumar-left-india-bloc-to-join-bjp-led-nda-bihar-politics-jdu-rjd-alliance-11706435699140.html,153,Right-leaning,0.062,0.088,0.85,-0.9446
Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's tit-for-tat answer for Rahul Gandhi's ‚Äòcorrupt CM‚Äô comment: ‚ÄòCongress' Gandhi family is‚Ä¶‚Äô,"After Rahul Gandhi referred to Himanta Biswa Sarma as the ‚Äòmost corrupt chief minister‚Äô, the latter hit back at Congress leader saying, ‚Äòmost corrupt family of the country - Gandhi family of Congress.‚Äô 







    Soon after 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' entered Assam, Gandhi on Thursday commented that perhaps the ""most corrupt government"" in India is functioning in the state¬† 




   ""Today BJP and your chief minister (Himanta Biswa Sarma) are dividing Assam. Maybe, the most corrupt chief minister in the country is the chief minister of Assam.""        ‚ÄúYou know what is happening here. We will raise the issues of Assam during the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra',"" he told party workers.




   Later, the Assam CM reacted to the comments saying, ‚ÄúThe Gandhi family is the most corrupt family in the country. This is not 'Nyay Yatra, it's 'Miya Yatra'. Wherever there are Muslims, they visit those places,"" Sarma was quoted as saying by PTI.¬†    Miyas refer to Muslims who migrated to Assam from what is now Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan), occurring in successive waves over time.""",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/assam-cms-tit-for-tat-answer-for-rahul-gandhis-corrupt-cm-comment-congress-gandhi-family-is-11705579755478.html,154,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.054,0.083,0.863,-0.9442
Milind Deora's resignation from Congress long in the making; Mumbai South seat in question,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi set out on his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on Sunday from Imphal, Manipur, while Senior Congress leader Milind Deora announced his resignation from the grand old party to join Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena.¬† 







    Hours after he ended his lengthy association with the Congress party by joining the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, Milind Deora blamed Congress' deviation from its ‚Äúideological and organisational roots, lacking appreciation for honesty and constructive criticism"".¬† 




   However, reports have suggested that the exit from Congress for Milind Deora was long in the making and not a sudden decision.¬†        Congress' communication chief Jairam Ramesh had told Indian Express that Milind Deora remained skeptical about the South Bombay Lok Sabha seat.    Notably, the Congress and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray) faction are now opposition INDIA bloc allies, which meant that the South Bombay seat was likely to be allotted to Shiv Sena (UBT) during seat-sharing talks.¬†  Mumbai South Lok Sabha seatMilind Deora had contested the last four elections from Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat, and represented the constituency from 2004 to 2014.    Milind Deora lost Mumbai South to the Shiv Sena‚Äôs Arvind Sawant in 2014 and 2019, abruptly quitting as the Mumbai Congress president in the middle of the Lok Sabha campaign five years ago to focus on his efforts to win back the constituency.    However, Arvind Sawant, the MP from Mumbai South stayed with Uddhav Thackeray even as Eknath Shinde led a clout to rebel, thereby dividing Shiv Sena.¬†    Reports reveal that former CM Uddhav Thackeray is said to have pushed for the Mumbai South constituency to remain with Shiv Sena .    In a recently released video Deora was seen advising his supporters and workers to remain calm and asked Sena not to stake a claim on any Lok Sabha constituency unless it is finalised in the seat-sharing talks.  Milind Deoara unhappy with INDIA bloc seat-sharing?Jairam Ramesh had told Indian Express that Milind Deora wanted him to intervene and put in a word with Rahul Gandhi.¬†    ‚ÄúHe spoke to me on Friday. He wanted me to explain to Rahul Gandhi that his seat was going. He said he is concerned. He messaged me at 2.48 pm. I spoke to him at 3.40 pm. I told him to meet Rahul(Gandhi) and explain,"" Indian Express quoted Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said.  How Mumbai South votes?Mumbai South has a significant Muslim population along with a Marathi electorate and is cosmopolitan. In the last two polls, the Mumbai South constituency has voted for an undivided Shiv Sena.¬†  Why Milind Deora joined Shiv Sena?The fact that Mumbai South has voted for the undivided Shiv Sena in the past two elections might have influenced Milind Deora's decision to join Shiv Sena and not Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). However, it still remains unclear if Deora will be granted the Mumbai South constituency by Shiv Sena.    The BJP has not yet given up its claim on Mumbai South and names such as currently Speaker Rahul Narwekar and minister Mangalprabhat Lodha have been floated during talks.  Mumbai South and DeorasMurli Deora in 1977 was elected mayor of Bombay with the support of Shiv Sena. He first contested the Lok Sabha polls from Bombay South constituency in 1980 but lost to the Janata Party's Ratansingh Rajda though, in the subsequent election, Deora defeated BJP's Jayawantiben Mehta by a huge margin. He was re-elected in 1989, 1991 but lost to Mehta in 1996 and 1999.    Murli Deora's son, Milind, defeated Jayawantiben Mehta to go to the Lok Sabha from the same constituency in 2004. In 2009, Milind Deora won the Mumbai South seat again.

"Koeri, Bhumihar, Kurmi: Nitish Kumar's new team balances caste equation in Bihar government","Bihar politics saw its umpteenth upheaval when its longest serving chief minister Nitish Kumar decided to break an alliance again to join the one he left, again! Nitish Kumar on Sunday broke the Mahagathbandhan alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Congress. The once front runner of INDIA bloc also quit the alliance and joined hands with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), a political alliance the Bihar CM had vowed never to look back upon a couple of years ago.¬† 







    Nitish Kumar took oath as the chief minister of Bihar on Sunday, after requesting the Bihar governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar to dissolve the previous Mahagathbandhan government, which has Tejaswi Yadav as Deputy Chief Minister. Nitish Kumar was sworn in the chief minister of Bihar for the record 9th time.¬† 




   The swearing-in of ministers in Bihar's NDA government on Sunday appears to have been influenced by caste considerations and loyalty.        Bihar now has two deputy chief ministers- Samrat Choudhary, a Koeri, and Vijay Sinha, a Bhumihar.¬†    This decision by the NDA, helmed by Nitish Kumar in Bihar, evidently points at the power structures attempting to appease OBCs while maintaining the support of the core upper caste base, in a state where caste politics trumps everything else.¬†    Among those sworn in as members of Nitish Kumar's council of ministers, apart from the two deputy CMs, are BJP‚Äôs Prem Kumar, JD(U) leaders Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, Vijendra Yadav and Shravan Kumar, Hindustan Awam Morcha leader Santosh Kumar Suman, and Independent MLA Sumit Kumar Singh.    Notably, Nitish Kumar, Samrat Chaudhary, and Santosh Kumar Suman are Members of the Legislative Council (MLCs).    Among the Ministers sworn in were Samrat Chowdhary, Vijay Kumar Sinha and Prem Kumar (BJP), Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Vijay Kumar Chowdhary and Shrawan Kumar (JD-U), Santosh Suman (HAM-S and son of Jitan Ram Manjhi) and Sumit Kumar Singh (Independent).    Political observers note that NDA leaders carefully balanced caste considerations in the cabinet formation.  CM Nitish Kumar told reporters that the cabinet will be expanded in a day or two and other factors will be kept in mind.    According to news agency PTI report, whenever the Bihar cabinet expansion takes place, it will accommodate legislators belonging to other castes, minorities group and women.    The new cabinet comprises three upper caste ministers including Vijay Choudhary and Vijay Sinha from the Bhumihar community, and Sumit Kumar Singh (Independent) from the Rajput community. Shravan Kumar (JD-U) belongs to the Kurmi caste, the same as CM Nitish Kumar.    Recent caste survey in Bihar indicate that Kurmis constitute 2.8 per cent of the total population.    A senior JD(U) leader highlighted the NDA's effort to include diverse social groups in the cabinet, citing examples like Prem Kumar from the Kahar caste and Vijendra Yadav from the Yadav community. Santosh Kumar Suman of HAM represents the Mahadalit community.    With the provision allowing a maximum of 35 ministers in the cabinet, the current swearing-in ceremony saw only eight ministers taking office.

‚ÄòMar jana qubool hai lekin‚Ä¶‚Äô: Nitish Kumar‚Äôs old video on BJP resurfaces as he heads to rejoin NDA in Bihar | Video,"An old video of Nitish Kumar's remarks on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) resurfaced on Sunday as the Janata Dal (United) chief junked the Mahagathbandhan in the state to return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In the video, Nitish Kumar, with his deputy and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav standing next to him, is heard saying: ‚ÄúMar jana qubool hai, unke saath jana humko kabhi qubool nahi hai, ye acchi tarah samajh lijiye."" [Rough translation: Dying is acceptable, going with them is never acceptable to us, understand this] 







    The video was purportedly shot in January 2023 and has resurfaced at a time when Nitish Kumar has decided to return to the BJP. Nitish Kumar met Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar at Raj Bhavan in Patna and submitted his resignation letter. 








       Nitish Kumar's reaction had come after BJP workers in Bihar were told that there would be no realignment with ""unpopular"" Nitish Kumar. ‚ÄúThe CM has the proclivity to oscillate like a pendulum. But we are not going to be cheated by him again,"" the then state unit chief Sanjay Jaiswal said.¬†    The video is being shared widely on social media on Sunday morning amid the speculation that Nitish Kumar would be pulling a major flip-flop by breaking away from the Mahagathbandhan government in Bihar and rejoining the NDA.    A similar alliance change to break the government had happened in 2022 when Nitish Kumar had resigned to snap ties with the BJP and formed an alliance with the RJD and the Congress.  NITISH KUMAR RESIGNSNitish Kumar submitted his resignation as Bihar chief minister to Governor Rajendra V Arlekar on Sunday morning, officials said. The governor accepted Nitish Kumar's resignation, and asked him to continue as caretaker CM till a new government is formed, they said.    Nitish Kumar was accompanied by senior minister Bijendra Yadav of the JD(U) when he went to the Raj Bhavan. The BJP is likely to submit the letter of support to JD(U) and Nitish Kumar to stake claim to the government. A new government with the support of the BJP is likely to be in place by the evening.

"Bihar politics news: Nitish Kumar seeks time to meet Governor, Mahagathbandhan leaders huddle | 10 points","The political turmoil in Bihar, centered on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's departure from the Opposition alliance to take on PM Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections 2024 and subsequently rejoining the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has seen a surprising twist. Bihar Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Chief Samrat Choudhary has refuted speculations about Nitish Kumar rejoining the NDA, that he left in 2022, asserting that the party's high command has ‚Äúno clue"" about such developments. 







    Despite this, sources have reported that Nitish Kumar has sought time to meet the Governor in the first half today. It is speculated that Nitish Kumar will sack ministers belonging to alliance partner and Lalu Yadav's party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to replace them with the BJP legislators, sending the Mahagathbandhan parties into a huddle. As the Bihar political crisis continues to unfold with intricate twists and turns, here are 10 latest updates on the current development threatening the INDIA unity. Bihar politics news LIVE updates 




 BIHAR POLITICAL CRISIS: 10 LATEST UPDATESWhile Nitish Kumar has maintained silence over the recent developments in Bihar, he will reportedly resign as the chief minister today, Sunday, to dump the Mahagathbandhan from the government.Nitish Kumar is ‚Äúlikely to address a meeting of JD(U) legislators around 10 a.m. Sunday before going to Raj Bhavan to submit his resignation"".Formation of a new government in Bihar is likely to happen in the evening with the BJP support. Nitish Kumar is also likely to sack all the RJD ministers, replacing them with ministers from the saffron party.Several NDA leaders including former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi have indicated an alliance breakdown between JD(U)-RJD. Also Read | Is INDIA bloc splitting? Here what JD(U) advises Cong to keep alliance runningEarlier on Saturday, BJP leader and Union Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey participated in the foundation laying ceremony of development works with CM Nitish Kumar, deepening the speculation that an alliance between the two parties might be underway.Ahead of the big day in Bihar, Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders huddled at Rabri Devi's residence in Patna where Nitish Kumar's deputy Tejashwi Yadav hinted at many unexpected developments in the state. ‚ÄúBihar mein abhi khel hona baki hain' [The game is yet to begin in Bihar]"" Tejashwi reportedly told the RJD leaders.On why Nitish Kumar was rejoining the NDA camp, sources have claimed that January 12 meeting with the INDIA bloc was the last nail in the alliance coffin. At the meeting, while some party leaders, including Lalu Prasad Yadav and Sitaram Yechury, suggested Nitish Kumar's name as INDIA convenor, Rahul Gandhi interjected, saying a decision on this should wait as Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal had suggested Mallikarjun Kharge's name.Notably, the BJP held a state executive committee meeting in Bihar's Patna amid the speculations of Nitish Kumar joining the NDA. A meeting was also held at Amit Shah's residence in New Delhi.RJD is the largest alliance partner in the 'Mahagathbandhan,' which includes Congress and three Left parties and falls eight members short of a majority in the assembly in the event of Kumar's JD(U) pulling out.If Nitish Kumar crosses over to the NDA, this would be the fourth time he would be switching sides ‚Äì between Congress, BJP and RJD ‚Äì that has also earned him a moniker ‚Äú'Paltu Ram"". Nitish Kumar deserted the BJP from the alliance government in 2022 to join hands with the Congress and RJD.(With agency inputs)

Bengal conundrum plaguing INDIA Bloc? Mamata vs Adhir vs CPI(M) cast aspersion ahead of Lok Sabha Polls,"INDIA bloc suffered its umpteenth dent from West Bengal, when on Wednesday Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declared that she would not form an alliance with Congress for seat-sharing in West Bengal.¬† 







    Notably, the TMC versus Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury skirmish had been broiling for quite sometime, also considering both parties have been rivals since Mamata Banerjee won the first state Assembly Elections.¬† 




   Reportedly Mamata Banerjee was willing to offer no more than two seats to Congress from West Bengal, which was rejected by Adhir Chowdhury, the Congress leader from the state.¬†        With Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) as the sworn rival for the 2024 Lok Sabha Polls, the INDIA bloc in West Bengal seems like a pipedream, possibly impossible to achieve.¬†    Here is a breakdown  CPI(M) versus TMCThe age-old rivalry between CPI(M) and TMC is an anecdote unfamiliar to none. Therefore it seemed evident that these parties would have the biggest trouble joining hands for West Bengal. Attesting to this belief, it was reported that CPI(M) refused to join Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in West Bengal, if TMC joins.¬†    According to Indian Express, a senior AICC member had called Bengal CPI(M)‚Äôs state secretary Mohammad Salim from Delhi Sunday to invite him to join the Yatra when it enters the state.    Salim told the Indian Express that CPI(M) would give its complete support to Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Nyay Yatra. However, the communist party refused to join ‚Äúany political force who helped BJP to grow their organisation in West Bengal"".    ""It is Trinamool Congress which paved the way for BJP in Bengal to expand its organisation."" Salim told Indian Express.¬†  TMC on INDIA bloc seat sharingThe Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress has often vowed to go ‚Äòsolo', but refused to share more than two seats with Congress in West Bengal. TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced that her party has decided to go alone in the state in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.    ‚ÄúI had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go alone in Bengal,"" Banerjee said amid the seat-sharing tussle between the Congress and the TMC.    The CM also asserted that she has not spoken to anyone in the Congress on the seat-sharing issue.    The TMC's offer of two seats to the grand old party based on its 2019 Lok Sabha election performance, triggered tension among them, as the arrangement was deemed insufficient.  Adhir Chowdhury on TMC, Mamata BanerjeeBengal Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury has often infamously launched attacks on Mamata Banerjee. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Tuesday doubled down on his attack on Banerjee over the distribution of seats for Lok Sabha election.¬†    Targeting the Trinamool Congress supremo, Chowdhury called Mamata Banerjee an ‚Äúopportunist"" and said the elections would not be fought at her mercy.    ""This time, the elections will not be fought at the mercy of Mamata Banerjee. The Congress defeated the BJP and TMC in the two seats that Mamata Banerjee is leaving. The Congress party knows how to contest the elections. Mamata Banerjee is an opportunist; she came to power in 2011, with the mercy of Congress,"" the state Congress president said at a press conference.  Rahul Gandhi on TMC, Mamata BanerjeeRahul Gandhi who is in Assam as part of his Nyay Yatra tried to quell the damage been done by Adhir Chowdhury's repeated attacks by insisting that he had a good relationship with TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee.    ""The negotiations on seat-sharing is underway, I don't want to comment here. But Mamata Banerjee is very close to me and our party. Sometimes our leaders say something, their leaders say something, and it goes on. It's a natural thing. Such comments won't matter and these are not things that are going to disrupt things,"" Rahul Gandhi had said on Tuesday.

"'Real Shiv Sena': Uddhav Thackeray challenges Eknath Shinde, Maharashtra Speaker Narwekar to public debate","Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray challenged Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to have a public debate with him on the question: ‚ÄúWhich faction is the real Shiv Sena?"". Thackeray's comments came even as Narwekar announced last week that the faction led by Shinde was the ""real Shiv Sena"" when the split happened in 2022. 







    ""We have moved the Supreme Court against the judgement given by those fraud people. I challenge Rahul Narvekar and (Eknath) Shinde to appear before people and answer the question of whom Shiv Sena belongs to,"" Thackeray said on Tuesday. 




 ALSO READ: Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena ‚Äòreal‚Äô, rules Speaker | 10 points        On January 10, Narwekar held in a long-awaited ruling that the Shinde faction was the real Sena, while dismissing disqualification petitions filed by both Shinde and Thackeray camps against each other's MLAs following a split in the party in June 2022.    Uddhav Thackeray's faction of the Shiv Sena moved the Supreme Court on Monday against the Maharashtra speaker's order rejecting the plea to disqualify MLAs of Shinde's faction and declaring the latter as the ‚Äúreal Shiv Sena"".¬†    ""I am taking this battle to the people's court,"" Thackeray was quoted by PTI as saying at a press conference in Mumbai.    Before this, Eknath Shinde's faction had moved the Bombay High Court against the Maharashtra speaker's decision to not disqualify members of Uddhav Thackeray's faction of the Shiv Sena.    Amid the political uproar in Maharashtra, Speaker Rahul Narwekar said on Tuesday that for the last six days, ""some political leaders and workers have been misleading people about my judgment"". He accused Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders of ""using derogatory language"" against him. ""They don't even respect the Assembly speaker. It's really harmful to the democratic structure,"" Narwekar said.    ""The Supreme Court never said that appointment of Bharat Gogawale as whip (of Shinde faction) was wrong. SC said that the speaker must recognise the real Shiv Sena. Because I received claims from both sides, I gave my judgement according to the Supreme Court order,"" Narwekar was quoted by ANI as saying.

The political circles were abuzz as India prepared to see what the Centre had planned for the country ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 ‚Äî when the fate of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government will be decided. 







    After Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget 2024, Defence Minister Rajanath Singh said, ""This is an encouraging budget....We are fully confident that we will achieve the target of becoming a developed nation by 2047."" 




   However, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ‚ÄúNot very much came out of it (this Budget speech)."" He said there were a lot of rhetorical language and very little concrete on implementation"". Sitharaman said, ‚ÄúShe talked about a number of things which are couched in vague language like 'confidence' and 'hope' and so on.""      BUDGET 2024 POLITICAL REACTIONS: HIGHLIGHTS'Federalism weakened': Chidambaram¬†P Chidambaram, a Congress leader and former Finance Minister, said that Nirmala Sitharaman did speak about 'minimum government' and 'maximum governance', but in reality, the 'minimum government' has undermined federalism.    ‚ÄúThe FM spoke about minimum government and maximum governance. The minimum government policy, in reality, has undermined federalism. Staffed state governments with funds and virtually reduced the third tier of governance, panchayats and municipalities, to cyphers‚Ä¶"" Tap here to read more  'Roadmap to PM‚Äôs Viksit Bharat vision by 2047': Home Minister Amit Shah‚ÄúThe Union Budget draws the roadmap to achieve PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji's vision of a Developed Bharat by 2047,"" said Home Minister Amit Shah.    The Union Budget draws the roadmap to achieve PM Narendra Modi's vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. The budget speech sheds light on the milestones achieved by the Modi govt in the last 10 years on its journey to make Bharat the foremost nation in every sector during the Amrit Kaal. On the very foundation of these feats, the magnificent edifice of a Viksit Bharat is being built. My heartfelt gratitude to Modi Ji for leading the nation through this journey of excellence and to FM Nirmala Sitharaman for the insightful budget speech,"" wrote Amit Shah on X.  'Budget was hollow': SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur BadalShiromani Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, ""This budget was hollow.

It mentions the achievements of the past and a strong path towards the future. We will present the full budget in July...The number of taxpayers has increased.

This budget has impressed all of these four sections,"" says Madhya Pradesh Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya  'Not a budget to lure people...': Chirag Paswan‚ÄúThe most important takeaway is that it‚Äôs not a budget which is to lure the people of our country. I think it‚Äôs a progressive budget to consolidate the infrastructure and the economy,"" said LJP MP Chirag Paswan on Union Budget 2024.  'Disappointing budget': AAP MP Swati MaliwalAAP MP Swati Maliwal said, ""This is a disappointing budget. Inflation and unemployment are at their peak in the country but there is nothing about it in the budget...It is a disappointing budget for the common people.""  'Delivery was zero': DMK MP Dayanidhi MaranDMK MP Dayanidhi Maran said, ""The Finance Minister took a long time to hail praises but delivery was zero. They are going to present a white paper on the previous government... Nothing much has happened in the last 10 years. The people of the country are already disappointed. Moreover, you realise that performance incentives are given to the bridge companies, and not going to the deserving ones. People are rejected with this budget.""  'Budget reflects aspirations of young India': PM ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi said this interim budget is inclusive and innovative. ‚ÄúIt has confidence of continuity. It will empower all four pillars of Viksit Bharat- Yuva, Garib, Mahila and Kisan. This Budget gives the guarantee of making India a developed nation by 2047,"" he added.

""She talked about a number of things which are couched in vague language like 'confidence' and 'hope' and so on.

Jharkhand political crisis deepens as Governor delays appointment of Champai Soren as next CM; JMM likely to shift MLAs,"The political crisis in Jharkhand deepened on Thursday as the MLAs of the ruling JMM-Congress coalition accused Governor C. P. Radhakrishnan of delaying the appointment of Champai Soren as the next chief minister of the state. The MLAs claimed that the Governor told them that he would get back to them after reviewing all the papers, but they don't understand why there is so much delay. 







    The sources close to JMM claimed that the ruling coalition may shift its MLAs out of the state to prevent poaching attempts from the BJP. 




   Champai Soren on Thursday wrote to Governor C. P. Radhakrishnan and asked him to at meet 3:00 PM at Raj Bhawan. The JMM leader said that he will be presented there with all the MLAs to assure him that ""he has the ability to provide a stable government in the state.""        Amid all the significant developments, former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren released a video on Thursday, which was made before his arrest. Hemant Soren claimed that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has no evidence against him and he will continue to fight against the atrocities on the poor, Adivasis, Dalit, and the innocent.    ""Most probably ED will arrest me today, but I am not worried as I am Shibu Soren's son...After a full day of questioning, they decided to arrest me in matters which are not related to me. No evidence has been by them found yet. They also tried to spoil my image by conducting raids at my Delhi residence. We have to fight a new fight now against those who commit atrocities against the poor, Adivasis, Dalit, and the innocent..."" Hemant Soren said.  Hemant Soren approaches Supreme CourtFormer Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren also approached Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging his arrest by ED in the land scam case. A Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud-led bench has decided to hear his plea tomorrow.  Hemant Soren was represented by senior advocates like Kapil Sibal and Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi. During the hearing, the Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta contended that the Jharkhand High Court is already hearing a similar petition, after which Hemant Soren's advocate cleared that they had withdrawn their plea from the high court.

'It's a break': Hemant Soren's first reaction after ED arrest in money laundering case,"Jharkhand's youngest chief minister on Wednesday resigned from his post and was arrested immediately by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a land fraud case. Son of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) doyen Shibu Soren, Hemant Soren named senior JMM leader Champai Soren as his successor. After being taken into custody, Hemant Soren shared on X a poem in Hindi, which said, ""It's a break. Life is a great battle, I have fought every moment, I will fight every moment but I will not beg for compromise"". 







    ‚ÄúI will not give up in vain‚Ä¶ I will not accept defeat‚Ä¶ Jai Jharkhand!"" he added. 








       From taking charge of Jharkhand as its youngest chief minister at 38, Hemant Soren who was arrested by the ED has had a chequered career.    Not the first choice of his father Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) supremo Shibu Soren for inheriting his political legacy, Hemant was groomed in politics after his elder brother Durga died of suspected kidney failure in 2009.    Born on August 10, 1975, at Nemra village near Hazaribag, Hemant did his intermediate from Patna High School and later joined Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra in Ranchi, but dropped out.    He debuted as a Rajya Sabha member in 2009. Next year, he resigned from the Upper House of Parliament to take up the post of deputy chief minister in the BJP-led Arjun Munda government.    Two years later, the BJP-JMM government collapsed and the president's rule was imposed in the state.    In 2013, he took charge of the state as its youngest chief minister, with the support of the Congress and the RJD.    His first stint as CM was, however, short-lived as the BJP seized power in 2014 and Raghubar Das became chief minister. He went on to become the leader of the opposition.    With the support of his allies Congress and RJD, he stormed to power in 2019, with his party, JMM, alone winning 30 assembly seats, its highest tally ever in the 81-member House.  Soren's tenure in the Chief Minister's Office has not been smooth.    In 2022, he was staring at disqualification as an MLA, which would have resulted in him losing the CM's post, as a mining lease given to him was allegedly renewed after he became the state's chief minister.    Amid the conundrums, Hemant Soren established himself as a strong voice of the state's dominant tribal community. From ensuring doorstep delivery of services with initiatives such as 'Apke Adhikar, Apki Sarkar, Apke Dwar' to expanding the state government's pension scheme to include more people, social welfare has been a trait of his regime.    He has also been a strong advocate for the economic benefits of mining activities in the state reaching the tribals.  (With PTI Inputs)

Congress flags ‚ÄòChinese links‚Äô of Paytm Payment Bank following RBI action: ‚ÄòPM Modi brought only chaos‚Ä¶‚Äô,"Congress weighed in on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposing curbs on Paytm Payment Bank, and called the occurrence a failure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi government. Congress General Secretary in-charge Communications Jairam Ramesh said that the BJP-led NDA government in the Centre failed to keep a check on a ‚Äòcompany with Chinese links, which has faced penalties before‚Äô. 







  Jairam Ramesh took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to talk about the Paytm Payment Bank debacle. ‚ÄúWhy has a firm with Chinese links ‚Äî at one point with 31 per cent Chinese ownership and Chinese investment of more than  ‚Çπ7000 crore‚Äîwhich has previously been penalised by the RBI for noncompliance in 2022, not been kept under stricter monitoring?""Jairam Ramesh wrote. 




   Jairam Ramesh added, ‚ÄúDoes this have anything to do with Paytm‚Äôs vocal support on 9th November 2016 of the disastrous demonetisation decision?""    




 China link to PaytmVijay Shekhar Sharma, the largest shareholder of One97 Communications Ltd., the owner and operator of fintech giant Paytm, has 19.42 per cent holding, while Antfin, an affiliate of China‚Äôs Ant Group Co, has 13.5 per cent.    One97 Communications, which owns Paytm brand, holds a 49 per cent stake in Paytm Payments Bank Limited but classifies it as an associate of the company and not as a subsidiary.  RBI's order against Paytm Payments BankIn a major action against Paytm Payments Bank (PPBL), the Reserve Bank on Wednesday directed the lender to stop accepting deposits or top-ups in any customer accounts, wallets, FASTTags and other instruments after 29 February.    Further, withdrawal or utilisation of balances by its customers from their accounts, including savings bank accounts, current accounts, prepaid instruments, FASTags, and National Common Mobility Cards are to be permitted without any restrictions, up to their available balance.    Settlement of all pipeline transactions and nodal accounts (in respect of all transactions initiated on or before February 29, 2024) should be completed by March 15, 2024 and no further transactions would be permitted thereafter, RBI ordered.¬†  Why action on Paytm Payments Bank?The RBI directive follows persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns, the central bank said in a statement.    On March 11, 2022, the RBI had barred PPBL from onboarding new customers with immediate effect.   ONE 97 COMMUNICATIONS                    More Information

"‚ÄòI guarantee, CAA will be implemented in every state of India within 7 days,‚Äô says union minister Shantanu Thakur","Union Minister Shantanu Thakur has declared that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, also known as CAA, is set to be implemented nationwide within the next seven days. 







    As reported by PTI, Thakur made these remarks during a public rally in South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, on Sunday. ‚ÄúThe Ram mandir (temple) in Ayodhya has been inaugurated, and within the next seven days, the CAA will be implemented across the country. This is my guarantee. Not just in West Bengal, the CAA would be implemented in every state of India within a week,"" BJP's Lok Sabha MP from Bangaon, said. 








       Also Read: ‚ÄòCAA will be implemented the moment Covid ends‚Äô: Amit Shah in Bengal's Siliguri    Implemented by the Narendra Modi government, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA grants Indian nationality to persecuted non-Muslim migrants, including Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, and Christians, from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who arrived in India by December 31, 2014. The CAA, passed by Parliament in December 2019 and receiving presidential assent, triggered widespread protests in various parts of the country.    As reported by PTI, a senior government official mentioned that the rules for the CAA would be notified ""much before"" the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections.    In the wake of the passage of the CAA by Parliament in December 2019 and its subsequent Presidential assent, widespread protests erupted across different regions of the country.    Also Read: Lok Sabha Elections 2024 to be held on 16 April? Chief Electoral Officer says‚Ä¶    Despite being delayed for over four years, the implementation of the CAA requires the formulation of its associated rules.    Earlier on January 3, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi criticized the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), labelling it as ‚Äúunconstitutional"" and asserting that it is constructed on religious grounds. This statement comes a day after the Centre indicated that the rules for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 would be officially notified ‚Äúmuch before"" the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls.    Also Read: No one can stop CAA implementation': Amit Shah urges people to re-elect Modi, oust Mamata Banerjee    On December 27, Union Home Minister Amit Shah emphasized that the implementation of the CAA cannot be halted, as it stands as the law of the land. He also accused West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of misguiding the public on this issue, PTI reported.    According to the manual of parliamentary procedures, the norms dictate that the guidelines for any legislation should have been devised within six months of receiving the presidential assent. Alternatively, the government could have sought an extension from the Committees on Subordinate Legislation in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.    Also Read: Citizenship Amendment Act rules ready, set to be notified before Lok Sabha elections 2024    Over the past two years, more than 30 district magistrates and home secretaries across nine states have been authorized to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians arriving from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan under the Citizenship Act of 1955.

Raghuram Rajan to be MVA candidate for Rajya Sabha polls? Here's what we know so far,"Several reports claim that former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan could be a Congress or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate for the Rajya Sabha elections from Maharashtra. The MVA is a coalition of the Congress, the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) and the Shiv Sena (UBT). 







    The speculations turned rife when Rajan met Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray at the latter's residence in Mumbai on January 31. 




 ALSO READ: Rajya Sabha poll: Jaishankar, Derek O'Brien, 9 others to be elected unopposed, BJP likely to miss majority mark        Following the meeting, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray said in a post on Instagram, ""Truly a delight to host Raghu Rajan ji at our home, Matoshri. Apart from his already vast contribution to our economy on various roles, including being the Governor of the RBI, we strongly believe the future of the Indian economy must be guided by such individuals with a vision for the future.""    The elections for the membership of the Rajya Sabha will be conducted on February 27. Elections will take place for six Rajya Sabha seats from Maharashtra. The terms of current Rajya Sabha members from Maharashtra ‚Äî Prakash Javadekar, Anil Desai, Kumar Ketkar, V Muralidharan, Narayan Rane and Vandana Chavan ‚Äî will end on April 2.  ALSO READ: Rajya Sabha polls: TMC announces six new candidates    With the latest meeting with Raghuram Rajan ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections, political circles in Maharashtra are abuzz with rumours that economist could be nominated as a Congress candidate or a joint candidate of the MVA.    A report in Hindustan quoted a leader of the Uddhav Thackeray faction as saying that Rajan may be presented as the MVA candidate for the Rajya Sabha from the Congress. ""In this context, Rajan might have met Thackeray as a courtesy,"" the leader said. However, Congress sources added that nothing has been decided yet.  ALSO READ: Winter Session 2023: 45 opposition MPs suspended from Rajya Sabha for causing ruckus  Rajya Sabha polls: The number gameMaharashtra has a total of 288 assembly seats. Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha should consist of not more than 250 members ‚Äî 238 members representing the States and Union Territories, and 12 members nominated by the President.    According to the equation, each candidate ‚Äî might require at least 42 votes of the assembly members to win. The BJP is sure to win three out of six Rajya Sabha seats from Maharashtra, Free Press Journal reported.    Now, the Congress has 45 MLAs. In the recent past, the two major political parties of Maharashtra ‚Äî Shiv Sena and NCP ‚Äî split up. In such a situation, to show the unity of the MVA, Thackeray's faction and Sharad Pawar's faction can support the Congress candidates.

Is INDIA bloc splitting? Here what Nitish Kumar's JD(U) advises Congress to keep alliance running,"Amid all the clamour around Nitish Kumar ditching INDIA to join BJP, the JD(U) Bihar chief said that they are still with the opposition bloc but the Congress needs to do some serious introspection on ‚Äòalliance and seat sharing‚Äô to keep the alliance running. 







    ""All is well in Bihar's ruling Mahagathbandhan and the media speculations are driven by some agenda,"" Kushwaha said, as reported by PTI, and further added, ""I met the CM yesterday as well as today. It is a routine affair. There is no truth in the rumours doing the rounds. We also reject the rumours that party MLAs have been asked to rush to Patna"". 




   Kushwaha, however, said, ""We want the Congress, which is our alliance partner, to do some introspection with regard to its stance towards other constituents and sharing of seats. Our leader Nitish Kumar has for long been stressing on the need for early finalisation of seat-sharing deal so that we could concentrate on Lok Sabha polls"".        The state JD(U) chief also refused to acknowledge social media posts of Rohini Acharya, daughter of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, in which she appeared to have taken a swipe at Kumar. He stated, ""We take no notice of that because Rohini Acharya is not an RJD office-bearer"".  ‚ÄòNo doors permanently closed in politics‚Ä¶,‚Äô Sushil Modi saysMeanwhile, it seems that the BJP has also ‚Äòkept their doors open‚Äô for negotiation with Nitish Kumar.    Speaking to reporters, BJP MP and former Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said, ""As far as Kumar or the JD(U) are concerned, doors are never permanently closed in politics. Closed doors open when the time comes but whether they will open or not is for our central leadership to decide.""    ¬†




   However, a section of BJP leaders from Bihar are not keen on aligning with Kumar, claiming that his stock is down and his diminishing credibility will harm their party and leave the field open to the RJD-led opposition to cash in on the anti-incumbency against him.    Sources in both the BJP and the JD(U) suggested such a possibility but it remained unclear if Kumar, the unquestioned leader of his party, has finalised a deal with the BJP top brass.    Meanwhile, RJD MP Manoj Jha told news agency ANI, ‚ÄúI am confident that the CM (Nitish Kumar) will refute this doubt which exists currently, and Bihar will continue to be part of productive politics.""",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/is-nitish-kumar-joining-bjp-here-whats-jd-u-advises-congress-to-keep-india-alliance-running-11706263799491.html,174,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.073,0.039,0.888,0.9994

Acme aims to raise $300 million equity in push for green hydrogen,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Gurugram-based renewable energy firm Acme Group is looking to raise $300 million in fresh equity, as it aims to secure funds to bid for new power projects, three people with knowledge of the development said. 







    The company that recently sold 450-550 MW of power assets for $180‚Äì200 million to BluPine, an Actis PE-backed renewable energy platform, is in the process of appointing investment bankers for its equity funding, said one of the persons cited above on the condition of anonymity, as the discussions are private. 




   ‚ÄúIt is fairly early stage, and the company is looking at a PE (private equity) fund-raise opportunistically. They are likely to reach out to global PE funds, sovereign wealth funds and infrastructure funds,"" the second person cited above said. According to him, the company is looking at long-term partners.        ‚ÄúThis capital will be raised at the holding company level,"" the person added. ‚ÄúIt will help the firm bid for incremental projects under the green hydrogen push.""    A company spokesperson did not respond to emailed queries.    In November, Mint reported the group‚Äôs plans to sell up to 51% in its proposed infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) for around $1.3 billion (around  ‚Çπ10,800 crore). The firm, which is betting big on green hydrogen, has appointed global consulting firm EY to look for buyers.    There is a huge interest in green hydrogen in the country, with 5.8 million tonnes (mt) of green ammonia capacity coming up. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyzer that may be powered by electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. As part of its green hydrogen playbook, India wants to encourage green hydrogen exports to Japan, South Korea and Europe, and has allowed concessional green electricity, an inter-state transmission charges waiver, land in renewable energy parks and mega manufacturing zones for promoting green hydrogen and green ammonia, Mint reported.    Investments into companies focusing on the green hydrogen space are likely to gain momentum, with the government setting a target of 5mt of annual green hydrogen production by 2030 with a focus on exports under the National Green Hydrogen Mission.    The Acme Group has also been selected for setting up green hydrogen plant under the incentive scheme ‚ÄúStrategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition"" (SIGHT)‚Äîwith an allocated capacity of 90,000 tonne per annum. The company would get an incentive of  ‚Çπ30 per kg on average, for three years.    Founded in 2003 by Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, Acme Group aims to become a leading green energy provider in the world by 2030, and produce 10 mtpa of green ammonia and hydrogen. The company started working with various governments, partners and stakeholders to develop projects in various geographies such as Oman, India, Egypt, Australia, and Chile, its website shows. The group has lined up ambitious plans for India and has inked an agreement with the Karnataka government to invest  ‚Çπ52,000 crore to set up a green hydrogen and green ammonia project. The firm is also setting up a large green hydrogen and green ammonia project at a special economic zone at Duqm in Oman, which will require an investment of about $6 billion. Acme Solar has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Norwegian energy firm Equinor-backed Scatec ASA to design, develop, build and operate the facility. The plant will supply emission-free fuel to Europe and Asia.

Why Nitish Kumar rejected convenor post of INDIA bloc? Explained in 5 points,"A ""proposal"" to make Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar the convener of the INDIA bloc came up at the meeting of coalition leaders, a senior JD(U) leader confirmed. However, Kumar had ""so far not given approval"" to the offer.¬† 







    JD(U) national general secretary Sanjay Kumar Jha said it will be deliberated upon within the party even as he claimed that the Bihar CM was in favour of a Congress leader becoming the chairperson. 




   A virtual meeting of INDIA bloc leaders began on Saturday afternoon to review the seat-sharing agenda, participation in Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and other matters related to the alliance.      Why Nitish Kumar rejected the offer? 5 things to knowPTI had reported earlier that the JD(U) wanted Nitish Kumar as the convener but was being opposed by the TMC.¬†‚ÄúIf I am correct, Mamata Banerjee has already cleared the party‚Äôs stand on the proposal of making Nitish Kumar the convener, with other members of the alliance,"" a veteran TMC leader said, as reported by the Hindustan Times. The leader further reiterated that it is only Banerjee who will speak on this INDIA-alliance issue.Kumar, meanwhile, said he would only accept the role if all parties were in agreement, as reported by Indian Express.However, rejecting the reports, NCP president Sharad Pawar commented, ""There was a suggestion made by the INDIA bloc members (during the meeting) that Nitish Kumar be appointed as its convenor, but the latter said that a team of party chiefs should be formed and that there is no need to appoint a convenor.""‚ÄúThere is no need to project one face to seek votes. We will select the leader after the elections and we are confident of providing an alternative. In 1977, Morarji Desai was not projected as the prime ministerial face by the opposition.""¬†What were the key agendas of the meeting?On what was discussed during the meeting, Pawar said, the INDIA bloc meeting discussed programmes, policies to be taken up. It was decided that a committee would be formed that will decide on holding joint rallies of the allies all over the country    However, ""Candidates (for the Lok Sabha elections) were not discussed...We will discuss seat-sharing. For the Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, seat-sharing was discussed and we will announce once it is finalised,"" he said.    The NCP president further commented it was a positive sign that several parties were coming together to ally.    As the Lok Sabha elections draw near, India's political landscape is undergoing a significant reshuffling. The emerging INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) consortium is gearing up to challenge the established National Democratic Alliance, setting the stage for an electoral showdown.    Earlier in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA won 353 seats, the UPA stood at 91, and Others won 98. The voting was staggered in seven phases between April 11 and May 19, in which around 67 per cent of the nearly 900 million eligible people exercised their franchise to elect 542 members of the Lok Sabha.

"Ajit Pawar's NCP slams ally CM Eknath Shinde's 'eyewash' response to Maratha quota demand: ‚ÄòBirth decides caste, not‚Ä¶‚Äô","Maratha Quota Row: As Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde agreed to the demands of Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil, ally in Maharashtra government Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Chhagan Bhujbal tore into the state calling it a mere ‚Äúeyewash"".¬† 







    Bhujbal, who is the minister for food and civil supplies in the Maharashtra government questioned the ‚Äúbackdoor entry"" of Marathas into the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community. 




   On Saturday, 27 January, Jarange Patil called off his protest as the Maharashtra government responded to the demands with a draft ordinance regarding reservation in education and jobs under the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) category. Shinde offered the activist juice to end his indefinite hunger strike.        Following the developments, Bhujbal termed the draft notification issued by the state government providing Kunbi certificates to all Marathas as a mere ""eyewash"", and said caste is determined by birth and not affidavits.  Chaggan Bhujbal, an OBC leader, remarked ‚Äúbirth decides caste"".¬†  Maharashtra government issued a draft notification this morning to recognise as Kunbis all blood relatives of the Maratha community members whose Kunbi caste records have been found. Kunbi, an agrarian community, falls in the OBC category.    Manoj Jarange had been demanding Kunbi certificates for all Marathas.¬†    Bhujbal, the food and civil supplies minister, said, ""The draft notification issued by the state government providing Kunbi certificates to all Marathas is an eyewash. It was a matter of study whether it is injustice to OBCs or Marathas are being taken for a ride.""¬†    ""Intellectuals from the Maratha community should also think about it,"" he said, adding that the community was making backdoor entry into the OBC reservation.¬†    He was responding to questions on CM Shinde announcing that Marathas will get OBC benefits till they get reservation.¬†    ""Caste is determined by birth and not by affidavits,"" Chaggan Bhujbal said. ""What if Dalits and Adivasis also make a similar demand of all blood relatives be given the caste certificate,"" the leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Ajit Pawar, asked.¬†    Bhujbal also hit out at Manoj Jarange over his demand to reserve vacancies in job recruitment for Marathas and 100 per cent free education to members of the community. ""Why only Marathas? Let all castes, including Brahmins, be given free education,"" he said. Bhujbal said he has invited all OBC leaders for talks on Sunday to discuss the issue.

Amit Shah to hold BJP‚Äôs organisational meetings in Telangana on Thursday,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah will chair the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs (BJP) organisational meetings in Telangana on Thursday, December 28. He is leading the saffron party's push in a slew of states, including West Bengal and Odisha, to emerge as a dominant player there in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. 







    According to a report by PTI citing BJP leaders, Amit Shah will attend a meeting of the party‚Äôs core group, which includes senior leaders from the state, in Hyderabad and later interact with ‚Äòmandal‚Äô presidents of the party from across Telangana. 




   On Tuesday, Amit Shah was in West Bengal along with BJP president JP Nadda. They held organisational meetings and set a target of winning 35 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, ruled by the Trinamool Congress (TMC).      PTI reported on Tuesday¬†that an election management committee is likely to be formed soon, comprising both old guards and new entrants, including central observers.    Shah, addressing the Bengal BJP‚Äôs social media cell, said: ‚ÄúIn 2024, the BJP will win more than 35 seats in West Bengal. The BJP will contest the election hinging on its social media strength because the regional media does not carry the message of the saffron party, fearing the TMC.""¬†¬†    During the programme, Shah said, ‚ÄúDidi's (Mamata Banerjee's) MP shares her password with businessmen in exchange for gifts, and now she is attempting to protect that MP. How many inquiries were made about the poor in Bengal? They will never do that because the poor cannot provide them with expensive gifts. Additionally, her MP mimics the vice-president?""    In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won 18 seats.    In the same election in Telangana, the saffron party had won four of the 17 seats.    In the recent Telangana assembly polls, the Congress wrested power from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS).    He will also pay obeisance at the Bhagyalakshmi temple.    According to the report citing sources, Shah is likely to travel to Odisha too in the coming days where the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has long been the strongest force.    In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won eight of Odisha‚Äôs 21 seats.¬†

'Hum bhi nahi hai kam kyunki...' Ramdas Athawale's poetic reply to INDIA's 'Hain Tayaar Hum' rally | Watch,"In response to Congress leader Jairam Ramesh's ‚ÄúHain Tayyar Hum"" remark for INDIA's upcoming rally in Nagpur, Union Minister of State Ramdas Athawale gave a witty response saying ‚ÄúHum bhi nahi hai kuch kam kyuki Hamare main hai Bahut dum kyuki Modi jee aur hum hain majboot."" 







    Taking a jibe at the INDIA alliance, MoS said that if Congress is ready then NDA is also ready because it has more strength than the grand old party. He also said that there will be no positive outcome of the rally as the Congress won't be able to leave any impact on people's mind. 




   Congress is set to begin its campaign for the Lok Sabha elections of 2024 with its mega rally set to take place in Nagpur on Thursday, December 28. The mega rally was named ‚ÄòHai Tayyar Hum‚Äô by Congress Congress General Secretary in-charge Communications, Jairam Ramesh.    




   ""If Jairam Ramesh is saying 'Hain Tayyar Hum', then 'Hum bhi nahi hai kuch kam kyuki Hamare main hai Bahut dum kyuki Modi jee aur hum hain majboot' (We, too, are not less because we have a lot of strength. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and our party are strong,"" Athawale told ANI on Wednesday.    Despite taking out as many rallies as Congress can, it won't be able to leave an impact on people, said the Republican Party of India President.    ""It is Congress's right to celebrate its foundation day. I agree. Your rally is being held in Nagpur but it will not have any effect on the people, no matter how much the Congress party tries. I also want to say that the alliance named INDIA cannot defeat Narendra Modi,"" he added.    He also added that NDA will win the general election of 2024 and will cross the 400 mark. He also criticised Congress minister and Waynad MP Rahul Gandhi and asked whom he talks about giving justice with his ‚ÄòNyay Yatra‚Äô.    ""Whom will he give justice to? If he wants to travel, then he has the right to do so, and this travel will not make any difference to the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" he said.    In Maharashtra, the NDA alliance will win more than 40 seats out of 48 Lok Sabha seats during the upcoming state assembly elections, he said. He also supported Vikhe Patil's statement that Mahayuti will win 42 Lok Sabha seats.    Earlier in the day, Congress had announced the Nyay Yatra that will start on January 16 in Imphal, Manipur, and will likely conclude on March 20 in Mumbai, Maharashtra. The party is expected to cover 14 states and 85 districts with this Yatra.

'Ram Lalla is mine too‚Ä¶': Uddhav Thackeray mentions Babri Masjid while making a request on Ram Temple event,"The politics around the invitations to the inauguration ceremony of Ram Temple in Ayodhya is not ending anytime soon as former Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray looks disappointed over not receiving an invitation. While mentioning the people who pulled Babri Masjid down in 1992, Uddhav Thackeray requested that the event should not be made political and he could always visit Ayodhya. 







  PM Modi Ayodhya Visit LIVE Updates""Ram Lalla is mine too. I can go anytime I wish. I can go now, I can go tomorrow. When I became the chief minister, I went to Ayodhya. I visited Ayodhya before that also. Yes, I have not received any invitation and I don't need one. I just have one request that this event should not be made a political one,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray said. 




   While the government decided to keep Uddhav Thackeray away, his estranged uncle and chief of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Raj Thackeray has been invited to the the consecration ceremony.        While taking a jibe at Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis who claims to be arrested for participating in kar seva, Uddhav Thackeray said, ‚ÄúThose who pulled the Babri Masjid down are not there today. Maybe a handful of them are. Some people may have gone on a school picnic because they were of that age at that time.""  Political drama over invitationsThe invitations for the inauguration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya on 22 January have triggered a political storm in the country with Opposition alleging that the government wants to make the event political. The Ram Temple trust has decided to keep the invitee list small, which excludes Chief Ministers and Governors of states, but the top leadership of national political parties is invited to the event.    The Opposition parties are still mulling over the political mathematics of attending or skipping the event with Congress giving mixed signals when asked if its President Mallikarjun Kharge, former president Sonia Gandhi, and Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary will attend the ceremony.    CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has announced that he will not attend the ceremony while West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also indicated that she will stay away from the Ram Temple event.  Bal Thackeray's role in Babri Masjid demolitionThe reaction from Uddhav Thackeray comes as the Shiv Sena (UBT) is attacking the government for not inviting their leader, whose father Balasaheb Thackeray, had a major contribution to the Ram Temple movement. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that when the mosque was demolished in 1992, BJP blamed Balasaheb Thackeray and the Shiv Sena leader took the responsibility.    ¬†

"PM Modi speaks on Pannun assassination claims, US-India relations: Top quotes","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would look into any information it receives in connection with the Gurpatwant Singh Pannun ‚Äòmurder‚Äô bid. The development comes weeks after the US Justice Department said that an Indian government official had been involved in the attempt. Officials have also unveiled charges against a man accused of orchestrating the murder bid. 







    ‚ÄúIf someone gives us any information, we would definitely look into it. If a citizen of ours has done anything good or bad, we are ready to look into it. Our commitment is to the rule of law,"" Modi told the Financial Times this week. 




   Both India and the Joe Biden-led US administration have made efforts to build closer ties in recent months in the face of shared concerns about China's growing power. The Pannun allegations came mere weeks after Canada said it was looking at credible allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.      Mint Explainer: The fallout of the Pannun allegations    The Prime Minister however insisted that a ‚Äúfew incidents"" would not damage ties between the two countries. Modi voiced ‚Äòdeep concern‚Äô about the activities of overseas extremist groups, insisting that these elements were ‚Äúengaged in intimidation and incited violence"" under the guise of freedom of expression.    ‚ÄúThere is strong bipartisan support for the strengthening of this relationship, which is a clear indicator of a mature and stable partnership. Security and counter-terrorism co-operation has been a key component of our partnership. I don‚Äôt think it is appropriate to link a few incidents with diplomatic relations between the two countries,"" the PM added.    New Delhi set up an investigating committee earlier this month to probe the US allegations. Meanwhile American prosecutors have accused an unidentified Indian official of directing Indian national Nikhil Gupta to orchestrate Pannun's murder in ¬†the murder of the Sikh activist in June.    ¬†    (With inputs from agencies)

"Home Minister Amit Shah withdraws three bills to replace criminal laws from LS, brings new legislation with suggestions","Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday withdrew and restored the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita, 2023, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita, 2023 and the Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill,2023 







    Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday withdrew three bills to replace criminal laws from Lok Sabha, brings new legislation with suggestions. Lok Sabha will discuss bills to replace criminal laws on Thursday, voting on Friday said ¬†Amit Shah. A parliamentary panel had made several suggestions, instead of moving different official amendments, new bills have been introduced announced Amit Shah. 




   ‚ÄúThe Bill was examined by the standing committee on Home Affairs, and a lot of suggestions were taken into consideration and thus it is being replaced with amendments. The discussion of the bill will be taken up day after tomorrow (after 48 hours). Most of the changes are grammatical and only 3-4 parts have been replaced,"" said Amit Shah.        The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill was introduced first in the Lok Sabha on August 11 along with Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam bills. The three bills seek to replace the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 1898, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, respectively.    In the reintroduced bills, at least five changes have been made, including in the definition of terrorism.    In the Bharatiya Nyaya (second) Sanhita Bill, the definition of terrorism now includes the word ""economic security"", among other changes.    ""Whoever does any act with the intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, sovereignty, security, or economic security of India or with the intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country...,"" it says.    The bill has brought changes in Section 73, making it punishable to publish the proceedings of a court which may reveal the identity of victims of rape or that of similar offences without the court's permission.    Section 73 now states, ""Whoever prints or publishes any matter in relation to any proceeding before a court with respect to an offence referred to in Section 72 without the previous permission of such court shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.""    The printing or publication of the judgment of any High Court or the Supreme Court does not amount to an offence within the meaning of this section, it explains.    Home Minister Amit Shah, in three identical signed statements submitted to Parliament, had said the decision to withdraw the three bills and introduce them afresh was taken after the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs made recommendations suggesting changes in the three bills following a series of discussions with domain experts and various stakeholders.    He had said in the statement for withdrawal that to make comprehensive amendments to the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023, was introduced in Lok Sabha on August 11 to repeal and replace the IPC.    This bill was referred to the department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs on August 18 for consideration.    Shah said the committee held several rounds of discussions with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, domain experts and various stakeholders and submitted its reports along with its recommendations on November 10.    ""Based on the recommendations of the committee, amendments are proposed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023. It is proposed to introduce a new bill in place of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023,"" he conveyed to the Parliament.    Two similar statements for withdrawal were also made regarding the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.    Soon after the bills were introduced in Lok Sabha on August 11, Shah urged the Chair to send the bills to the standing committee for a threadbare discussion.    Subsequently, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar referred the three proposed laws to the committee, which comes under the Rajya Sabha secretariat, and asked it to submit its report within three months.  *With Agency Inputs

Bhajanlal Sharma named Rajasthan CM: All you need to know about the first-time BJP MLA backed by Vasundhara Raje,"First-time member of the state Legislative Assembly, and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Bhajanlal Sharma was declared as the new chief minister of Rajasthan. The saffron party on Tuesday picked the first-time MLA from Sanganer as the new chief minister, ending days of speculation that followed its victory in the assembly polls. 







    The surprise choice was announced after the newly elected BJP MLAs met in Jaipur and elected MLA Bhajanlal Sharma as the legislature party leader. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and party observers Vinod Tawde and Saroj Pandey attended the meeting, where the BJP's Rajasthan election in-charge Pralhad Joshi was also present. 




   At the meeting, the CM-designate‚Äôs name was proposed by former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who was herself considered to be in the running for the top post.      Bhajanlal Sharma also served as the State General Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. The Rajasthan CM-designate is also among the longest-serving general secretaries of the BJP in the state    Following the 2023 Rajasthan Legislative Assembly election, Bhajanlal Sharma was elected as an MLA from the Sanganer Assembly constituency, which is said to be a stronghold of the BJP.  Bhajanlal Sharma secured his position by defeating Pushpendra Bhardwaj, the candidate from the Indian National Congress (INC), with a margin of 48,081 votes.¬†  Bhajanlal Sharma's residence is at Jawahar Circle in Jaipur. The Rajasthan CM-designate is originally from Bharatpur.    In his earlier days in politics, Bhajanlal Sharma has been with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the BJP's ideological mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).    An upper-caste leader, Bhajanlal Sharma being BJP's chief ministerial choice is a digression from the saffron party's other CM candidates in the Hindi heartland- Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh.¬†    According to data available with the Election Commission of India, Bhajanlal Sharma, 56, is a postgraduate. He declared assets worth  ‚Çπ1.5 crore, which includes  ‚Çπ 43.6 lakh in moveable assets and  ‚Çπ 1 crore in immovable assets.

Sanjay Raut charged with sedition as 'Saamana' article stirs pot against PM Modi,"Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut has been charged with sedition and other offences for publishing a controversial article against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the party's publication, ‚ÄòSaamana‚Äô. 







    As reported by PTI citing a senior official on Tuesday, the FIR was registered after BJP's Yavatmal district coordinator Nitin Bhutada complained to the Rajya Sabha member, who is the executive editor of Saamana. 




   Responding to the allegations, Raut accused the BJP of engaging in ‚Äúcensorship."" Raut said, ‚ÄúThe BJP had no right to say that it stood up against the Emergency because the fight was against such kind of censorship. The criticism in Saamana is political.""        Also Read: Sanjay Raut invokes Uddhav Thackeray‚Äôs name for INDIA bloc‚Äôs PM candidate, says he is a ‚Äònationalist face‚Äô




   According to the complaint, Bhutada asserted that Raut penned the objectionable article on December 10.    The filing of the case took place on Monday at Umarkhed police station in Yavatmal, registering charges under sections 124(A) (sedition), 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups based on religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred, or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code, as per the official.

The editorial contended that inflation is reaching alarming levels, causing a surge in the prices of essential goods, and there is a looming concern about shortages in grains, pulses, and sugar. Additionally, the article raised questions about the government's awareness of the situation and its efforts to alleviate the burden of inflation on the common man.  (With inputs from PTI)

Ethics panel report on TMC MP Mahua Moitra to be tabled in Lok Sabha at 2 pm | 10-point,"The Lok Sabha's Ethics Committee on Friday submitted its report in the Lok Sabha recommending the expulsion of Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra over the ""cash-for-query"" allegation. 







    Trinamool Congress members and some from the Congress trooped in the Well of the House raising slogans demanding a copy of the report. 




   Congress leader Manickam Tagore said, ‚ÄúCongress party is going to oppose the motion. This is an attack on parliament. When an MP asks a question in relation to a corporate, there is a conspiracy to disqualify the lawmaker through the ethics panel"".      Mahua Moitra defamation case: Delhi High Court renotifies matter for December 11    Before arriving at the Parliament, Moitra on Friday said that now the people will see the battle of Mahabharata.    Mahua said ""Mother Durga has arrived, we will see. These people who have started snatching clothes will now see the battle of Mahabharata.""    Ethics Committee Chairman Vinod Kumar Sonkar tabled the panel's first report when the House re-convened at noon after an adjournment during the Question Hour. The Lok Sabha has been adjourned till 2 pm now. Moitra, while leaving the Parliament said she hadn't seen the Ethics Committee report yet, and added, ""Let me have my lunch and come back. Whatever has to happen, will happen after 2 pm..."".  Nishikant Dubey accuses Adhir Ranjan of leaking ethics panel report on Mahua    Moitra, a first-term MP, will be disqualified from the parliament if the report of the Ethics Committee is adopted today and if the government moves a motion for her expulsion.    However, Opposition parties MP, including Moitra, will get a chance to debate on the report before any motion is moved, Lok Sabha officials said.  Here are 10 updates on Ethics Committee vs Mahua Moitra case:The political storm began on 15 October when Nishikant Dubey, a BJP MP, addressed a letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, accusing Moitra of accepting bribes from businessman Darshan Hiranandani, the CEO of the real-estate conglomerate Hiranandani Group, in exchange for raising parliamentary questions.Dubey's letter stated that out of the 61 questions asked by Moitra in the Parliament, 50 were aimed at billionaire Gautam Adani and his conglomerate Adani Group.CBI has registered preliminary enquiry against TMC MP Mahua Moitra  The matter took a deeper turn when Hiranandani revealed to the Ethics Committee that Moitra had shared her Parliament login ID so that the businessman could ‚Äúpost questions on her behalf"".Hiranandani also said Moitra wanted to get fame and her friends advised that ‚Äúthe shortest route to fame is by attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi"".Cash-for-query: Ethics panel suggests ‚Äòexpulsion‚Äô of Mahua Moitra from Lok Sabha  Last month, the Ethics Committee, which investigated the allegations made by BJP MP Dubey, adopted its 500-page report on November 9 recommending Moitra's expulsion from the 17th Lok Sabha in view of her ""highly objectionable, unethical, heinous, and criminal conduct.""The draft report was adopted by a 6:4 majority in the panel last month.Six members of the panel voted in favour of the report, including Congress MP Preneet Kaur who had earlier been suspended from the party. Four members of the panel belonging to opposition parties submitted dissent notes.The TMC party has demanded that Moitra be given a chance to put forth her defence.¬†Congress MP Shashi Tharoor slammed the Centre regarding the report, saying that it's a 'political vendetta'. ""Incredibly inadequate reported. It seems to have been adopted in two and a half minutes, according to one of the members. There has been no proper procedure followed, no attempt to cross-examine those who have made accusations, and at the same time the conclusion of such a major punishment as expulsion of a Member - to arrive that without serious consideration is truly disgraceful. Opposition, all the INDIA Alliance parties are completely convinced that this is a travesty of justice, it would set a very undesirable precedent for the future,"" Tharoor said.""I don't think it has been a fair and equitable procedure...We want her to continue in the Parliament. This is a normal style of the BJP to silence voices against it, this is yet another attempt. Of course, we are opposing it,"" Congress MP Karti Chidambaram said.    Congress Lok Sabha Chief Whip K Suresh said, ""If the report states the expulsion of TMC MP Mahua Moitra, we will oppose it tooth and nail.""

"Sachin Pilot was being chased, his movement tracked, phone tapped in 2020 by state govt, claims Ashok Gehlot OSD","Internal strife between Rajasthan's outgoing CM Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot is not hidden from anyone. Ashok Gehlot's officer on special duty (OSD) has made another revelation related to the internal dispute between the two leaders. 







    Ex-Rajasthan CM, Ashok Gehlot had carried out a surveillance on Sachin Pilot when he along with his loyalist MLAs had rebelled in 2020. He also added that Sachin Pilot's phone was also being tapped when he was stationed at Manesar with 18 party MLAs that year. 




   ‚ÄúThere was a political crisis in Rajasthan when Sachin Pilot along with 18 MLAs had gone to Manesar. It is quite natural that the government carries out surveillance measures to track people a person in question is meeting. The government was on the verge of a collapse,"" Lokesh Sharma told news agency ANI.    




   He also said that Pilot was constantly monitored along with his people and their meetings. The main reason behind such actions was to be prepared with corrective measures to be taken if he moved ahead with his rebellion.    It was due to this monitoring that we were able to bring some people back. Following a person was a part of monitoring,"" Sharma added.    The Congress tried its best to rise above the internal disputes and win state assembly elections in Rajasthan, however, things turned disastrous for the grand-old party.    He asserted that it was being done on the instructions of Ashok Gehlot to save the Congress government in the state.    ""During the political crisis in Rajasthan, when Sachin Pilot had gone to Manesar with 18 MLAs, it is natural that state government tracks the movement in such cases. So, the state government was keeping track of Sachin Pilot and the people he was meeting. Sachin Pilot was being monitored on where he was going, and who was he talking on to the phone so that corrective measures could be taken,"" told ANI.

"Vice-President draws parallels between Mahatma Gandhi and PM Modi, says 'Mahapurush and yugpurush....'","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday drew parallels between Mahatma Gandhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, describing the father of the nation as ""mahapurush"" of the last century and PM Modi as ‚Äúyugpurush"" of this century. He called them ‚Äútwo great personalities"" while focusing on common things between them. 







    Addressing an event dedicated to Jain mystic and philosopher Shrimad Rajchandraji, Dhankhar said, ‚ÄúMahatma Gandhi freed us from the slavery of the British through satyagraha and non-violence. India‚Äôs successful Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken us to a path where we always wanted to be."" 








       ‚ÄúI want to tell you one thing. The mahapurush of the last century was Mahatma Gandhi. Narendra Modi is the yugpurush of this century,"" the Vice-President said after unveiling a mural of Shrimad Rajchandraji, who was born in Gujarat in 1867 and died in 1901. He is known for his teachings on Jainism and spiritual guidance to Mahatma Gandhi.    Dhankhar added, ‚ÄúOne thing is common between these two great personalities, the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, and PM Narendra Modi. They have reflected with respect to Shrimad Rajchandraji. Such was the greatness of Shrimad Rajchandraji, that he inspired both Mahatma Gandhi and PM Modi.""  Opposition calls it ‚Äòshameful'His statement drew criticism from Congress leader Manickam Tagore who said that it is ‚Äòshameful‚Äô to compare PM Modi with Mahatma Gandhi. ""If you compare with Mahatma it's shameful sir, we all know there is a limit to sycophancy now you have crossed that limit, and to be in your chair and position and to be a sycophant does not add value, sir,"" Tagore wrote on X.    Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali wondered on social media platform X, ‚ÄúI would like to ask the Vice President which new era has begun by giving liberty to an MP of the PM‚Äôs party to abuse a certain community.""    ¬†  (With inputs from agencies)

"'Cash-for-posting' row: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah defends son, calls HD Kumaraswamy 'an expert in...conspiracy theories'","Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah hit out at former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy for levelling ""cash-for-posting"" allegations against his son on Saturday. He said the Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS) leader ""is desperate for attention"" and that he has ""become an expert in coming up with conspiracy theories"". 







    In a series of tweets on Saturday, Siddaramaiah clarified on a viral video of his son Yathindra Siddaramaiah and denied his involvement in the ""cash-for-posting scam"".¬† 




   Taking potshots at Kumaraswamy for levelling such allegations, the CM said, ""Looks like former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy is desperate for attention. Medically it is termed as Histrionic Personality Disorder. Better to address it soon than never.""      What's in the viral viral video and what did HD Kumaraswamy allege?Sharing the viral video clip on social media, Kumaraswamy accused Yathindra of being involved in a ""cash for posting scam"".    In the purported video Yathindra, a former Congress MLA, is heard saying, ""Hello Appa (Father), Vivekananda! To where? No I didn't give that. Give it (phone) to Mahadeva. I had given only five."" Then he speaks to Mahadeva, ""Mahadeva, why are you giving something...? Who has given that? Nothing but whatever 4-5 I have given, that alone should be done,"" news agency PTI reported.  ALSO READ: Siddaramaiah says Karnataka farmers incurred loss of  ‚Çπ30,000 crore due to drought    According to Kumaraswamy, Yathindra spoke to R Mahadeva, a sub-registrar at Ganganagar in Bengaluru, who has been appointed as the CM's Officer on Special Duty R Mahadeva.    On Saturday, Kumaraswamy alleged that an official's name mentioned in a phone conversation, reportedly between Siddaramaiah and his son, has figured in the transfer list of police inspectors released on the previous night.    Kumaraswamy sought to know how did Vivekananda, who figured in the phone conversation, appear in the transfer list within 48 hours of the charges he levelled.    The JD(S) leader even shared the transfer list issued by the police department on November 17. The order list comprising 13 names showed transfer of an official by name Vivekananda from state intelligence to VV Puram police station in Mysuru city.    ¬†




   Kumaraswamy said in a tweet, ""This video clip is a proof that the job posting for money, 'Cash for Posting', scam has been going on in Karnataka. Congress' recovery business has come to the fore. Do we need greater proof that Karnataka's collection king father and son of Karnataka's collection King have extorted money? The Chief Minister conducts a transfer business without shame.""  What Siddaramaiah saidCriticising HD Kumaraswamy for making up ""conspiracy theories"" on the video, Siddaramaiah clarified that the phone call he had with his son was about corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and not 'cash for transfer' as alleged by Kumaraswamy.    The CM said his conversation with Yathindra Siddaramaiah was related to the development of government schools in Varuna Constituency.    ""The document which was released was signed off by Mysuru Taluk BEO (Block Education Officer) Vivekananda. Conversation over the phone was about this Vivekananda who had signed off the list of schools for development,"" the CM said.    However, he alleged that Kumaraswamy came up with the name of an officer by name Vivekananda in some transfer list.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/cashforposting-row-karnataka-siddaramaiah-defends-son-jds-hd-kumaraswamy-expert-conspiracy-theories-lies-11700304658717.html,194,Neutral or no clear political inclination,0.112,0.046,0.842,0.9855
Modi condemns death of civilians in West Asia war,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday made plain his views on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, stating India strongly condemns civilian deaths arising from the devastating war. Speaking at the second edition of the Voice of Global South Summit in New Delhi, which saw leaders of Mauritius, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Kyrgyzstan, among others, in attendance, Modi said: ‚ÄúIndia has condemned the heinous terror attacks in Israel on 7 October. We have urged restraint along with dialogue and diplomacy. In the conflict between Israel and Hamas, we strongly condemn the death of civilians. After speaking with (Palestinian) president Mahmoud Abbas, we have sent humanitarian aid to the people of Palestine."" 







    The Global South itself has been divided in its response to the West Asian crisis, which erupted on 7 October, when Hamas militants launched a series of terror rocket attacks across Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, and abducting several Israelis. While some countries voted for a recent UN General Assembly resolution calling for a ceasefire in the conflict, several countries including India abstained. Others, such as Pacific island countries Nauru and Fiji, voted against the resolution. 




   At the Voice of Global South summit, Modi‚Äôs main focus during his remarks was India‚Äôs advocacy for the interests of the group, particularly through its Presidency of the G20.        He cited the progress made on accelerating reform of the multilateral development banks (MDBs), climate finance, sustainable development goals and digital public infrastructure. He also pointed to the African Union joining the G20 as a permanent member as a key success.    ‚ÄúGeographically, the Global South has always been there. But it is receiving a voice in this manner for the first time. This has been possible due to our joint efforts. We are more than 100 different nations. But our interests and our priorities are similar,"" Modi told the leaders.

    Following the completion of the raid, the APP minister told ANI news agency that nothing suspicious was found during the searches. Anand slammed the central government for the agency's actions, asserting that the raid was merely a pretext to harass individuals. 








       ""Raid is just an excuse to harass people. They (ED) received nothing during the search. They have got orders from the above...I feel that in this country saying truth and doing politics for the poor is a sin,"" he said.    He further said that these actions taken by the agency are an 'effort' to destroy Aam Aadmi Party.    ""The customs case that ED is talking about is twenty years old. These people want to destroy the Aam Aadmi Party, they want that there should be no politics of work,"" he added.    Also read: Delhi Minister Raaj Kumar Anand's house raided by ED in money laundering case    The ED officials visited Anand's residence yesterday at around 7:30 am in the Civil Lines area.    The probe against Anand is being undertaken as per provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).    The ED probe stems from a charge sheet filed by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on charges of false declarations in imports for customs evasion of more than  ‚Çπ7 crore apart from international hawala transactions.    A local court recently took cognisance of the DRI prosecution complaint after which the ED filed a PMLA case against Anand and some others.    Also read: List of political leaders ED raided or summoned in past few months    Anand joins a long list of senior AAP leaders, including party supremo and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who are under the scanner of central agencies in different cases.    Annad was inducted into the Delhi Cabinet in November last year. The 57-year-old is the minister for social welfare and SC/ST welfare in the Arvind Kejriwal-led government. He is an MLA from Patel Nagar.   ARVIND                    More Information

    Reacting Congress's accusation, BJP leader and their IT cell head Amit Malviya has backed the Centre in its directions asking bureaucrats to talk about the programs and schemes implemented by the government. He said that bureaucrats are duty bound to serve the people, as the elected government ""deems fit"". 




   BJP national President JP Nadda also tweeted, ‚ÄúIt baffles me to see the Congress Party have an issue with public servants reaching the grassroots to ensure saturation of schemes. If this not the basic tenet of governance, what is? Regarding opposition to a ‚ÄòRath‚Äô it is a fit use of public resources unlike using warships as personal yachts :)""      What is the Rath Prabhari issue?-The post shared by Pawan Khera is an internal order of the agriculture secretary of October 14 regarding showcasing or celebrating the achievements of the last nine years of the Modi government through the ‚ÄúViksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra"" proposed to be organised across the country for disseminating information, awareness and extending services at the gram panchayat level from November 20 to January 25.

   -Slamming the Centre, Khera wrote, ""How can civil servants be ordered to do political propaganda for a government going into elections?""    -The Congress has accused the BJP of appointing officers as part of ‚Äòpolitical propaganda‚Äô  Mallikarjun Kharge writes to PM Modi-As part of the discontent, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his government's orders saying that all agencies, institutions, arms, wings, and departments of the government are now officially 'Pracharaks'.    -Congress president Kharge also said that in view of protecting democracy and the Constitution, it is imperative that the orders which would lead to the politicising of bureaucracy and our Armed Forces must be withdrawn immediately.  What India government says?-Modi has set a target of six months to ensure the full saturation of his government‚Äôs welfare schemes, PTI reports    -The government will launch a mega drive ‚Äî Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra ‚Äî across all 2.7 lakh panchayats in the country to reach out to the beneficiaries and enroll them.    -PTI reports, citing people in the know, the exercise will begin after Diwali next month and continue for several weeks.    -Specially-fitted ‚Äúraths"" (chariots) will reach the beneficiaries across the country, they said.

"AAP dissolves all of its units in Uttarakhand for the second time, new appointments to be declared soon","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announced the dissolution of all of its units in Uttarakhand for the second time. The new appointments will be announced soon, the party said in its social media post on X, formerly Twitter. 







  Also Read: Assembly Elections 2023: AAP proposes changing 2nd phase of Chhattisgarh polls due to Chhath festival 




   ""The Aam Aadmi Party hereby dissolves the present organisation of Uttarakhand state with immediate effect. We thank all office bearers for their contribution so far. New office bearers will be appointed soon"", said the AAP in a post on 'X'.    




   The party has dissolved its Uttarakhand unit for the second time. Earlier, the party had announced the dissolution of the Uttarakhand assembly unit after its dismal performance in the Uttarakhand assembly elections in 2022.¬†    In the 70-member legislative assembly, the Bhartiya Janata party rules in 49 seats, the Congress owns 19 seats, whereas the Bahujan Samaj Party owns two seats. Whereas AAP failed to open its account.    In the last assembly elections, BJP emerged as the single largest party. The Indian National Congress settled at the second spot in the elections and lost the opportunity of retaining the government in the state. Last month, several people joined the Aam Aadmi Party.    Currently, Uttarakhand government is led by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. He is serving as the 10th and the current Chief Minister of Uttarakhand since 2021. He won the state assembly elections of 2021 from Champawat Assembly constituency. In previous state assembly elections he won from Khatima from 2012 to 2022. Interstingly, he is the only Chief Minister of the state to assume a second consecutive term as CM since the formation of the state.    As five states are set to vote for their next government in the state assembly elections this year, Aam Aadmi Party is campaigning with full strength in Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, and Rajasthan.

Telangana Elections 2023: BJP revokes suspension of MLA T Raja Singh over anti-prophet remarks; gives him poll ticket,"Ahead of the Telangana Assembly elections 2023, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday revoked the suspension of MLA T Raja Singh following his reply to the show-cause notice issued by the party after a row was triggered by his remarks against Prophet Muhammad. He was suspended in August and issued a show-cause notice. 







    Om Pathak, member secretary of the party's Central Disciplinary Committee said, ‚ÄúUnder suspension, the Central Disciplinary Committee of the party issued a show cause notice to you."" 




   ‚ÄúThis refers to your reply to the show cause notice. Your reply and explanation offered therein have been considered by the committee. Basis your reply, the committee has decided to revoke your suspension forthwith,"" it added.¬†        Days after suspension, Singh said he was confident that the BJP would revoke his suspension soon, and would contest the Telangana Assembly polls from the Goshamahal constituency on the BJP ticket.    He had also ruled out the possibility of joining BRS or Congress. It is pertinent to note that Telangana is set to witness an intriguing triangular contest between the BRS, Congress, and BJP. Raja Singh's name has also been listed in the BJP's first list of 52 candidates for the November 30 state assembly polls.¬†    In the previous Assembly elections in 2018, the BRS won 88 of the 119 seats, hogging 47.4 percent of the total vote share. The Congress finished a distant second with 19 seats and a vote share of 28.7 percent.    Polls will be held in Mizoram on November 7, Chhattisgarh on November 7 and November 17, Madhya Pradesh on November 17, Rajasthan on November 25 and Telangana on November 30.    The counting of votes will take place on December 3 in all the states. Of the five states, polling in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases.

‚ÄòIf Congress behaves like this‚Ä¶‚Äô: Akhilesh Yadav continues to spar with INDIA ally over MP seat sharing,"The INDIA alliance was left on shaky grounds this week as the Samajwadi Party failed to reach a seat sharing agreement in Madhya Pradesh. Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has dubbed the Congress stance a ‚Äòbetrayal‚Äô and hinted at similar treatment towards the other party in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile BJP leaders asserted that the spat had shown the ‚Äòreal character of Congress‚Äô.¬† 







    ‚ÄúIf Congress didn't want to give seats (in MP), then they should have said it before. Today, SP is fighting only on seats where it has its own organisation. Now after Madhya Pradesh, I know that the INDIA alliance is for the (parliamentary) elections at the national level. If Congress continues to behave like this, then who will stand with them? If we will fight against the BJP with confusion in our minds, then we won't succeed,"" Yadav said on Friday. 




   Congress UP unit chief Ajay Rai had earlier asked the SP to withdraw from MP in favour of the grand old party as the Akhilesh Yadav-led party, he said, did not have any base there.      ALSO READ: MP polls: Akhilesh targets Cong after snub, says 'I would not have trusted..'The SP chief said that despite the INDIA alliance formation, the SP strategy would be based on working for the PDA (Pichada, Dalit and Alpsankhyak).    Meanwhile Congress leader Kamal Nath ruffled fresh feathers after avoiding questions on the matter and asking reporters to ‚Äòforget about Akhilesh Yadav‚Äô.    ‚ÄúAre bhai chhodo Akhilesh Vakhilesh‚Ä¶The environment is very good. People are calling us and telling us that there is enthusiasm amongst the people. We will win with an even better number than we had expected,"" he told reporters in Chhindwara.    ‚ÄúWhen elections are held, tussle over tickets is a natural thing. Everyone feels that the ticket should be given to the strongest contestant. I think Akhilesh Yadav is one of the most important parts of the INDIA alliance and many from our party are in touch with him, there is nothing which cannot solved after having a discussion on it..."" added Congress leader Supriya Shrinate.

Darshan Hiranandani 'forced to sign a white paper': TMC MP Mahua Moitra on 'Cash for Query' allegations,"Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has replied to the affidavit of businessman Darshan Hiranandani, alleging that ""he was forced to sign a white paper."" 







    In a two-page statement, Moitra raised a few questions over the credibility of the affidavit that Hiranandani reportedly submitted to the Parliament Ethics committee, claiming that it is ""neither on official letterhead nor notarised"" and that the contents of the letter are ""a joke."" 




   ""The affidavit is on white paper, and not an official letterhead or notarized. Why would one of India's most respected/educated businessmen sign a letter like this on white paper unless a gun was put on his head to do it?"" Mahua said in a press statement.        Also read: TMC MP Mahua Moitra files defamation case against BJP's Nishikant Dubey amid furore over ‚Äòcash for queries‚Äô claim    ""The contents of the letter are a joke. It has clearly been drafted by some half-wit in the PMO who doubles up as a creative writer in the BJP's IT cell. It sings paeans to Modi and Gautam Adani while linking every opponent of theirs to me and my alleged corruption,"" Moitra alleged.    Further, attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the TMC leader said, ""Paragraph 12 claims that Darshan gave in to my demands because he was fearful of displeasing me. Darshan and his father run one of India's largest business groups and their recent projects in UP and Gujarat have been inaugurated by the CM of Uttar Pradesh and by the Prime Minister. Darshan accompanied the PM abroad as part of his business delegation very recently. Why would such a wealthy businessman who enjoys direct access to every minister and the PMO be coerced by a first-time opposition MP into giving her gifts and giving into her demands?""    ""It is totally illogical and only cements the truth that the letter was drafted by the PMO and not Darshan"", the TMC MP stated.    Also read: Nishikant Dubey's allegations on Mahua Moitra: Opposition calls it 'gimmick', BJP says 'need immediate probe'    She further asked businessman Hiranandani why he did not release the letter officially if he had ""confessed"" to the claims.    ""If indeed he was to witness all of my corruption, why was he with me during the time, and why did he wait till now to make it public? Also if he wrote to the CBI and the LS speaker, why out of the 543 MPs would he forward the letter to Nishikant Dubey, whom I have repeatedly exposed in the parliament and the outside and against whom, I have filed pending privilege motions?"" she questioned.    Claiming that Businessman Hiranandani was ""compelled"" to sign the letter, Moitra said, ""The PMO held a proverbial gun to Darshan and his father's heads and gave them 20 minutes to sign this letter sent to them. They were threatened with a total shutdown of all their businesses. They were told they would be finished, the CBI would raid them and all government business would stop and all PSU bank financing would be stopped immediately.""    ""The draft of this letter was sent by the PMO and he was forced to sign it. And it was leaked to the press immediately,"" she said.    ""This is the usual modus operandi of this BJP government or rather Gautam Adani's government run by the BJP. Every effort is being made to malign me and isolate and scare those near and dear to me,"" she alleged.    ""I will continue to stand up to Mr Adani until he answers the many questions that he is duty-bound to answer to the people of this great country,"" she added.    The face-off between BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and TMC MP Mahua Moitra over his 'Cash for Query' allegations has taken a fresh turn.    Hiranandani, who was allegedly behind the said payoffs has for the first time responded in an affidavit.    The businessman said that he resides in Dubai and came across letters dated October 14, by Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai to the CBI and to BJP MP Nishikant Dubey where his name figured prominently. He says he has been following the events carefully.    In his affidavit, the businessman admits to his friendship with the TMC MP.    ""I have known Mahua since I met her at the Bengal summit 2017.....Over a period of time, she has become a close personal friend of mine...However, as our interactions grew over time she asked for odds and ends which involved my time"" the affidavit reads    Hiranandani then claims that the TMC MP saw attacking the Adani group as a route to fame.    ""She became Lok Sabha MP in May 2019.... She was advised by her friends that the shortest route to fame was by attacking Narendra Modi. She thought that the only way to attack PM Modi was by attacking Gautam Adani and his group as they both come from Gujarat"" his affidavit reads.    Hiranandani then claims that Mahua Moitra did share her Parliament Login credentials with him.    ""She knew that Indian Oil Corporation was getting into an arrangement with Dhamra LNG a joint venture of the Adani group..... She drafted a few questions that she could raise in parliament that would have elements to embarrass the Govt and target the Adani group. She shared with me her email ID as MP, so I could send her information and she could raise the questions. I went along with her proposal"" he claims in his affidavit.    Darshan Hiranandani also claims that he used the TMC MP's login credentials to pose questions on the Adani group himself.    ""She also received unverified details from several sources including some claiming to be former Adani group employees.....Certain information was shared with me, based on which I continued to draft and post questions using her Parliamentary login"" he says in his affidavit.    Hiranandani then claims that the TMC MP also demanded favours and gifts from him.    ""She made frequent demands of me and asked for various favours, The demands included gifting her expensive luxury items.....travel expenses, holidays etc"", he claims in his affidavit.    This latest affidavit by Hiranandani came even as the Ethics committee has called Nishikant Dubey and Advocate Jain Anant Dehadrai to submit oral evidence on the charges of 'Cash for Query' made by the BJP MP.

Bihar caste-based census news: CM Nitish Kumar calls an all-party meeting to discuss results. Top Updates,"A day after releasing data from a caste-based census in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has called an all-party meeting to discuss the results of the survey and deliberate on the next course of action. ""A meeting will soon be convened of all the nine political parties with an electoral presence in the state legislature and the facts and figures will be shared with them,"" Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday, PTI reported. 







    1)According to the data, the state‚Äôs total population stood at a little over 13.07 crore, out of which the Extremely Backward Classes (36 per cent) were the largest social segment followed by the Other Backward Classes at 27.13 per cent. 




   2)The survey also stated that Yadavs, the OBC group to which Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav belongs, was the largest in terms of the population, accounting for 14.27 per cent of the total.        3)Dalits, also known as the Scheduled Castes, accounted for 19.65 per cent of the total population in the state, which is also home to nearly 22 lakh (1.68 per cent) people belonging to the Scheduled Tribes.    4)Those belonging to the ‚Äúunreserved"" category, which denotes the proverbial ‚Äúupper castes"" ¬†comprise 15.52 per cent of the total population.    5) The Congress also welcomed the Bihar government's move to release the findings of a caste census and called upon the Centre to immediately conduct a similar exercise at the national level. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the caste census of Bihar has proved that 84 per cent of people in the state are OBCs, SCs, and STs and their share should be according to their population. ""Out of 90 secretaries of the central government, only 3 are OBC, who handle only 5 per cent of India's budget. Therefore, it is important to know the caste statistics of India...,"" Gandhi said in a post in Hindi on X.    6) RJD president Lalu Prasad issued a statement, in which he said that the survey will set the tone for ""a nationwide caste census which will be undertaken when we form the next government at the Centre"".¬†    7) Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the opposition of ""trying to divide the country in the name of caste"" for six decades -- a ""sin"" that it is committing now as well. ‚ÄúEven they had a chance & it is their failure that they could not do it. Even then they used to play with the feelings of the poor & they are doing it even now. Even then they used to if the country on the basis of caste & even now they are doing the same,"" PM Modi said in Gwalior on Monday.    8) The caste-based survey was ordered last year after the Narendra Modi government at the Centre made it clear that it would not be able to undertake a headcount of castes other than SCs and STs as part of the census.    9)The state cabinet gave its nod to hold a caste survey on June 2 last year when it also allocated an amount of  ‚Çπ500 crore for the mammoth exercise.    10) The last time a census of all castes was conducted was in 1931.  -With agency inputs    ¬†

‚ÄòNobody takes Rahul Gandhi seriously‚Ä¶‚Äô: BJP leader shares photo from Sharad Pawar's meeting with Adani,"BJP leaders took a fresh swipe at Rahul Gandhi on Saturday over NCP chief Sharad Pawar's meeting with Gautam Adani. The duo had come together in Gujarat's Vasna to inaugurate the country's first lactoferrin plant. According to reports the senior politician also visited the businessman's residence and office in Ahmedabad. 







    ‚ÄúI just hope that Sharad Pawar ji won‚Äôt be abused by likes of Alka Lamba again merely because nobody in INDI Alliance takes @RahulGandhi or his utterances seriously. This picture speaks a thousand words provided Rahul Gandhi is willing to listen,"" said BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla. 




   He re-shared photos of the event that were posted by Pawar on X (nee Twitter) earlier in the day to underscore his point.    




   ‚ÄúIt was a privilege to inaugurate India‚Äôs first Lactoferrin Plant Exympower in Vasna, Chacharwadi, Gujarat along with Gautam Adani,"" Pawar had tweeted earlier on Saturday.    The development comes at a time when INDIA leaders ‚Äì including Rahul Gandhi ‚Äì have taken repeated potshots at the businessman and his dealings with the Indian government.¬†    Pawar's closeness with Adani had previously come to the fore in April when the latter met the NCP chief at his Silver Oak residence in Mumbai. Pawar had also opposed the opposition's demand for a joint parliamentary committee to probe the charges against the Adani Group and said he would favour a Supreme Court-monitored committee.    ""Nowadays names of Ambani-Adani are being taken (to criticise the government) but we need to think about their contribution to the country. I think other issues like unemployment, price rise, and farmers issues are more important,"" he had said in April.¬†    (With inputs from agencies)

Govt to drop discussion on EC appointment bill in special parliament session: Report,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a union cabinet meeting amid the ongoing 5-day special parliament session. While the agenda of the union cabinet meeting was not announced, speculations are rife that ""historic decisions"" will be taken, in reference to PM Modi's earlier comment. 







    Before the special session of the Parliament commenced, the secretariats had issued an official statement chalking out the agenda of the special parliament session. The statement mentioned the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill, 2023 as part of the agenda. 




       However, latest reports have suggested that government may not push for passage of the bill on appointment of CEC and election commissioners in the five-day session of Parliament, news agency PTI reported citing people familiar with the developments. The bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha by Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on 10 August.    The people have informed PTI that one view within the government is to refer the bill to the standing committee on law and justice.    Some former CECs, including N Gopalaswamy, V S Sampat and S Y Quraishi, had on Saturday written to the prime minister opposing the provision to equate the CEC and the ECs to the cabinet secretary.    Opposition leaders spoke against the bill on Sunday at an all-party meeting convened by the government on the eve of the Parliament session.    Criticism, including from a few former CECs and ECs, of some of its provisions might have made the government reconsider its decision, the PTI report states.  What is the CEC Bill?The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill, 2023 seeks to replace the Chief Justice of India with a cabinet minister in the panel for selection of the chief election commissioner and election commissioners, in a move that will allow the government to have more control in the appointment of members of the poll panel.    The bill also said that salary, allowances and other service conditions of the CEC and ECs will be the same as that of the Cabinet Secretary, a change from their current parity with a Supreme Court judge. Critics have said it amounts to diluting the authority of the poll watchdog.    A vacancy will arise in the Election Commission (EC) early next year when Election Commissioner Anup Chandra Pandey demits office on February 15 on attaining the age of 65 years.

"Amit Shah slams Nitish-Lalu ‚Äòoil-water' alliance, says ‚ÄòThey changed UPA name to INDIA because‚Ä¶‚Äô","Hitting out at the Opposition's Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance or INDIA, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on 16 September alleged that it changed its previous name United Progressive Alliance because it didn't want to go to the public with a name associated with rampant corruption, reported Hindustan Times. 







    Shah also claimed Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's alliance is like oil and water and they can't remain together for long. 




   ‚ÄúThey have made a new alliance with a new name. They worked with the name of UPA and did corruption worth  ‚Çπ12 lakh crore. Lalu Yadav did corruption worth crores while he was the railway minister. They changed their name because they could not come back with the name UPA, hence they had to come up with INDI Alliance,"" news agency ANI quoted Shah said at a rally in Bihar's Jhanjharpur in the Madhubani district.      ALSO READ: DMK's Udhayanidhi Stalin, TKS Elangovan target Amit Shah for his 'Hindi unites' comment    Alleging that the opposition alliance is selfish, the senior BJP leader said, ‚ÄúLalu Yadav wants to make his son the chief minister. Nitish Kumar wants to be the prime minister. But it is not possible because the position of the prime minister is not vacant. Narendra Modi is going to take that position again. This alliance is taking Bihar back to Jungle Raj. Through appeasement, they are handing over Bihar to such elements that will not let Bihar be secure...""    Apart from this, Shah also raked up Bihar cabinet minister Chandra Shekhar's controversial remarks on Ramcharitmanas and DMK leader Udhayanidhi Stalin's remarks on ‚ÄòSanatana Dharma‚Äô.    ""People of this alliance disrespect Ramcharitmanas... cancel holidays on Rakshandhan and Janmashtami. They relate Sanatana Dharma to a number of diseases. All they can do is appeasement..., The opposition alliance opposed construction of the Ram temple,"" Shah said.    Among other things, the Home Minister claimed that the NDA will win all 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in the 2024 elections and break the 2019 record.    ""We won 39 seats in 2019, this time round we will break all records and win all 40 seats,"" he said.    Alleging that the law and order condition in Bihar was deteriorating every day and the ‚Äúopportunistic alliance"" will worsen the situation.    ‚ÄúThe law and order situation in Bihar is deteriorating every day and the presence of the Mahagathbandhan will worsen the situation furthermore in the coming days,"" Shah said.    ‚ÄúIf Modiji does not become the PM again, the entire ‚ÄòSeemanchal‚Äô region will be full of 'ghuspaithiyas' (intruders),"" Shah said at the rally.
