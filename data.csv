"BMC allots over  ‚Çπ500 crore to BJP-Shinde coalition MLAs for Mumbai development, none to Opposition: Report","Mumbai faces a stark imbalance in infrastructure development, according to an Indian Express investigation. The allocation of funds from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) leans heavily towards MLAs of the ruling BJP-Eknath Shinde Shiv Sena coalition. The pattern of sidelining those from the Opposition emerged from a February 2023 policy that enabled MLAs to request BMC funds for local projects. 







    More than  ‚Çπ500 crore was disbursed during Februaru-December 2023. The entire amount, as per the publication, was allotted to MLAs from the BJP-Shinde coalition.

However, the 15 opposition MLAs received none despite 11 requests. The funds, a small part of the BMC's  ‚Çπ52,619-crore budget, were meant for diverse development tasks. These range from drain repairs in Dharavi to park beautification in Sewri. The BMC, typically managed by 227 elected corporators, currently operates without an elected body.        Under this framework, Guardian Ministers authorise fund disbursements for MLAs' projects. While ruling party MLAs swiftly obtained approvals, the opposition faced roadblocks, reported the publication.

Opposition MLAs like Uddhav Bal Thackeray Shiv Sena‚Äôs Ravindra Waikar and Congress' Varsha Gaikwad, on the contrary, await funds despite repeated requests, as per Indian Express. This discrepancy extends to various constituencies and hinders essential civic work.    The Indian Express highlighted these disparities, shedding light on the challenges faced by opposition MLAs in garnering support for their constituencies' development.¬†  ‚ÄòNo pending requests‚ÄôGuardian Minister Lodha, however, insisted on a non-partisan approach to fund allocation. He said there were no pending requests from opposition MLAs.  Also Read: BMC withdraws 10% water cut for Mumbai, suburbs from today. Details here‚ÄúAt present, I don‚Äôt have any pending letters in my possession from the Opposition MLAs. We are disbursing the funds in a liberal manner by assessing the merit of the proposals, which we are receiving and there is no favouritism being done towards anybody,"" Lodha told the publication.

ED questions Tejashwi Yadav for over eight hours in land-for-jobs scam case,"The Enforcement Directorate questioned RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for more than eight hours on Tuesday in connection with a money laundering case. The development came a day after the agency quizzed his father Lalu Prasad Yadav about an alleged land-for-jobs scam. Opposition leaders meanwhile asserted that the BJP‚Äôs top leadership was ‚Äòafraid‚Äô and targeting them by ‚Äòmisusing‚Äô the central probe agencies. 







    The agency had filed a prosecution complaint against several members of the Yadav family at the beginning of January in connection with the scam. It alleges that the former Chief Minister's kin ‚Äî Rabri Devi, Misha Bharti and Hema Yadav ‚Äî received land parcels for nominal amounts as a bribe. 




   The ED probe was initiated on the basis of a CBI FIR that accuses former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav of indulging in corrupt practices. The case pertains to the appointment of Group D substitutes in Indian Railways between 2004 and 2009.¬†        The CBI filed its chargesheet in October last year against former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi, their daughter Misa Bharti, and 13 others. The central agency asserts that the candidates were asked to transfer land as a bribe in return for the jobs.




   Tejashwi Yadav arrived at the ED office in Patna amid heavy security deployment on Tuesday morning as a large number of RJD supporters raised slogans. The former deputy chief minister was quizzed for more than eight hours ‚Äî leaving the premises after 8 pm. Reports quoting sources indicate that his statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. However details about the interaction remain elusive at present.    He appeared before the probe agency a day after his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was questioned for nearly ten hours by the central agency in the same case.    (With inputs from agencies)

AAP candidate Kuldeep Kumar breaks down in tears after losing Chandigarh Mayor's post | Watch video,"Amid the allegations of the INDIA bloc against the BJP of voting discrepancies during the Chandigarh Mayoral elections, AAP candidate Kuldeep Kumar broke down in front of the media after losing Chandigarh Mayor's post by 2 votes from BJP candidate Manoj Sonkar. 

















   The BJP mayoral candidate Manoj Sonkar won 16 votes during the election, whereas, Kuldeep Singh, a joint candidate of Congress and AAP managed to secure only 12 votes. Whereas, eight votes were declared invalid.        After the announcement of the result, the AAP and the Congress attacked the BJP and alleged the saffron party of ""shameless capture"" of the democratic system in the country.    The BJP swept the Chandigarh mayoral polls retaining the three top posts in a setback to the AAP and the Congress which had contested the elections as allies.    After the announcement of the result, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal called the polls a ‚ÄúBlack day for democracy"". Later in the day, the AAP and Congress filed a joint petition in the Punjab-Haryana High Court expressing concerns about the integrity of the recently conducted mayoral elections in Chandigarh.    The matter will be taken up by the HC on Wednesday. The hearing will take place tomorrow morning after both the parties file a petition regarding the mayoral elections, said Ferry Sofat, the lawyer representing the AAP and Congress in the Punjab Haryana High Court.    ""What BJP did today to finish democracy - the whole country watched it. They tried to hijack the election. We have challenged the entire process in this writ petition. We have also submitted proper evidence‚Ä¶,"" said Sofat mentioning that the HC, in its previous hearing, had stated that the Mayor polls should be conducted freely and fairly with the entire voting process being videographed.    After the rejection of multiple votes during vote counting, ¬†AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged ""robbery"" by the BJP, describing their victory as a ""blatant theft.""    BJP's Manoj Sonkar's victory in the Chandigarh mayoral elections marked the first direct electoral contest between the BJP and the Opposition INDIA bloc. The elections were rescheduled on the directions of the Punjab-Haryana High Court.    Rejecting the INDIA bloc's allegations of discrepancies, newly-elected Chandigarh Mayor Manoj Sonkar said, ‚ÄúWherever they don't have their way, they level allegations...Everything is on camera. But when they couldn't digest their defeat, they created this atmosphere and started blaming us.""

Lok Sabha polls 2024: Samajwadi Party names 16 candidates; Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav to fight from Mainpuri,"The Samajwadi Party on Tuesday sounded the bugle of Lok Sabha elections 2024 as they released the list of candidates for 16 seats in Uttar Pradesh. The list includes the name of Dimple Yadav, the wife of SP's chief Akhilesh Yadav, who will contest the general elections from her current seat of Mainpuri. 







    The other candidates on the list include Shafiqur Rahman Barq from Sambhal, Ravidas Mehrotra from Lucknow, Akshay Yadav from Firozabad, Devesh Shakya from Etah, Dharmendra Yadav from Budaun, Utkarsh Verma from Kheri, Anand Bhadauria from Dhaurahra, Anu Tandon from Unnao, Naval Kishore from Farrukhabad, Rajaram Pal from Akbarpur, Shivshankar Singh Patel from Banda, Awadhesh Prasad from Faizabad, Lalji Verma from Ambedkar Nagar, Ramprasad Chaudhary from Basti, and Kajal Nishad from Gorakhpur. 




   The development is significant since Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party is part of the Opposition INDIA bloc and has been negotiating the seat-sharing arrangements with the Congress.        Uttar Pradesh is the most crucial state for the Lok Sabha elections and the good performance of the BJP in this state is one of the major reasons for their dominance at the national level. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 62 seats out of the total 80 while a pre-poll alliance between SP, BSP, and RLD managed to get just 15 seats.  Congress won just 1 seat in that election during which it lost some of its major bastions in Uttar Pradesh.  SP-Congress seat-sharing talksRecently, Akhilesh Yadav has signaled some breakthrough in the seat-sharing talks with Congress as he said that the Samajwadi Party is ready to give 11 seats to Congress. The grand-old party has been demanding 20 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which looks like a long-shot considering their performances in the general and assembly elections in the state.    The Mayawati's BSP has cleared that they will go solo in the Uttar Pradesh elections and that is going to work as a crucial advantage for the BJP.    ¬†

"Hemant Soren under ED lens: Jharkhand CM takes 1,200 km road trip to Ranchi amid ‚Äòmissing‚Äô claims | 10 things to know","In some significant political developments in Jharkhand, Chief Minister Hemant Soren was reported to be ‚Äúmissing"" for several hours before resurfacing in Ranchi, the state capital, on Tuesday. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader went to Delhi for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case, but the federal agency said that it failed to locate the leader. 







    The ED's claim raised political heat in Jharkhand as the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that Hemant Soren is ‚Äúon the run"" from the ED probe and it even released his ‚Äúmissing"" posters. 




 Hemant Soren faces ED probe: 10 things to know1. The team of the ED claimed that when they reached the Delhi residence of Hemant Soren for questioning, they failed to locate the leader.        2. However, the federal agency investigators found some ‚Äòincriminating‚Äô evidence when they searched his residence and seized his BMW car and  ‚Çπ36 lakh in cash.    3. As the word spreads, the BJP in Jharkhand claimed that the chief minister was absconding and even asked the Governor to take note of the matter.    4. ""It is the job of the Governor, I am doing it. We will cross the bridge when it comes,"" Jharkhand Governor CP Radhakrishnan said,    5. But the chief minister arrived at his residence on Tuesday and held a meeting with the members of the ruling alliance in Jharkhand.    6. Hemant Soren has said that he is ready for the questioning and will depose before the ED on Wednesday at 1:00 PM.    7.

Where was Hemant Soren? Jharkhand CM on his whereabouts after returning home in Ranchi,"After returning to his official residence in Ranchi amid suspense about his whereabouts, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren has said he resides in the hearts of people. 







    Soren, who is also the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) executive president, chaired a meeting of party legislators. 




   ""I reside in your hearts,"" he told reporters when asked about his absence.        Soren was speaking to the media at Bapu Vatika, where he went to pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary.    ""We all are committed to follow the footsteps and ideologies of the Father of the Nation. We are proud that such people were born among us and gave us guidance,"" he added.    Soren had left for New Delhi on January 27 night. Amid suspense about his whereabouts, he reached his official residence on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday.    He chaired a meeting of MLAs and ministers at his residence where his wife Kalpana Soren was also present.    All the legislators of the JMM-led ruling alliance in Jharkhand were asked not to leave the state capital, and to attend the meeting.    The meeting was called to discuss strategies regarding the current political situation, and the Enforcement Directorate's proposed questioning of the CM on Wednesday.    ""The Jharkhand CM has the blessings of the people, he will be unharmed. We are formulating strategies to face the tyrants,"" JMM spokesperson Manoj Pandey said without elaborating.    In an email sent to the ED, Soren has agreed to record his statement in a money laundering case linked to an alleged land deal in Jharkhand on January 31 at 1 pm at his residence.    Meanwhile, the federal agency searched the 5/1 Shanti Niketan residence of the JMM leader in south Delhi on Monday, and camped there for almost 13 hours to question him, officials said.

Chandigarh mayoral polls: Rahul Gandhi invokes Godse on ‚Äòcheating‚Äô claims; Kejriwal 'worried' for Lok Sabha | 10 points,"The Chandigarh mayoral polls witnessed high-voltage drama on Tuesday after the BJP defeated Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress, who were contesting the polls as part of the INDIA bloc. The AAP claimed that the presiding officer wrongly declared eight votes of Congress and AAP councilors invalid while Rahul Gandhi went a step further and invoked Nathuram Godse's assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.¬† 







    Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called it ‚Äúcheating in broad daylight,"" and a black day for the democracy of India. The national convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that if the BJP can ‚Äústoop so low"" to win a mayoral election then it can go to any extent to win the Lok Sabha elections. 




   ""This time under INDIA Alliance, Congress and AAP came together... Their (BJP) intention had been maligned since the beginning... They tried to buy ours and Congress' councillors. They tried to scare them like they do all over the country... But fortunately, not even one councillor broke down..."" the Delhi Chief Minister said.¬†        ‚ÄúIt is beyond imagination what the BJP, which can kill democracy in front of the whole world in the Mayor elections, will do to remain in power in Delhi. Years ago, on this day, Godse had assassinated Gandhiji and today Godseists sacrificed his ideals and constitutional values,"" Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said.¬†  Chandigarh mayoral polls: AAP accuses BJP of ‚Äòcheating‚Äô; 10 points1. The Chandigarh mayoral polls were conducted on Tuesday after the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which rapped the administration for delaying the elections earlier scheduled for 18 January.    2. In the 35-member corporation, the combined voting strength of the AAP and the Congress was 20, whereas the BJP held 15 votes, comprising 14 from councilors and one from MP Kirron Kher.    3. The voting started around 11:00 PM at the Assembly Hall of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation    4. After the counting, the presiding officer declared BJP's Manoj Sonkar as the winner with 16 votes and 8 votes of AAP and Congress councilors were not counted.¬†    5. The AAP launched a scathing attack on the BJP after the defeat and called it ‚Äòcheating in broad daylight.‚Äô ""The manner in which cheating has been done in broad daylight in the Chandigarh Mayor elections is extremely worrying. If these people can stoop so low in a mayor's election, then they can go to any extent in the country's elections. This is very worrying,"" Arvind Kejriwal wrote on X in Hindi.    6. The other senior AAP leaders also reacted to the developments in Chandigarh and said that the way elections were conducted was a setback for the Indian democracy.    7. ""This is not a setback for one coalition, one alliance or one party. It is a setback for India's democracy...We are aggrieved and hurt & we are worried as to what will happen in the upcoming 2024 polls. If the BJP can resort to such low levels & commit forgery & illegality...BJP can go to any level to rig the election process..."" AAP's Rajya Sabha member Raghav Chadha said.    8. ""This is robbery. In Chandigarh, there are 36 Councillor seats out of which 14 seats are BJPs & 13 seats are AAPs, and 7 seats of Congress. Total AAP (13 + 7) has 20 seats...BJP has been exposed again..."" Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said.    9. BJP chief JP Nadda congratulated his party for winning the Mayor elections and said that UTs are witnessing record development under the leadership of PM Modi.    10. ""Congratulations to BJP Chandigarh Unit for winning the Mayor election. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UTs have witnessed record development. That the INDI Alliance fought their first electoral battle and still lost to BJP shows that neither their arithmetic is working nor their chemistry,"" BJP chief JP Nadda said on X.    ¬†

"'A little pressure is exerted, he takes U-turn': Rahul Gandhi mocks Bihar CM, says 'we don't need Nitish Kumar...'","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday criticised Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and reiterated that 'Mahagathbandhan' will continue fighting for social justice in the state and the alliance does not need CM Nitish Kumar for the cause.

Also Read: ‚ÄòWant Nitish Kumar to stay‚Äô: Akhilesh Yadav blames Congress for Bihar political turmoil    In addition to making repeated attacks on CM Nitish Kumar, the Congress leader also reiterated the importance of the caste census. He said that Dalits and backward classes don't get due representation in all sectors of the country.




   ""The time has come for an X-ray of India to ascertain the population in this country. The first step towards social justice is an X-ray of the country,"" he added.    Rahul Gandhi also said the other backward classes (OBC) are the biggest community in India.

Is Congress' flawed strategy responsible for breakups in INDIA bloc as Lok Sabha polls near?,"The opposition INDIA bloc is in the grip of a political crisis as a key alliance partner, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, ditched the ‚ÄòMahagathbandhan‚Äô and returned to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) fold ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. 







    Apart from private meetings succeeded by press briefings, the INDIA bloc, formed seven months ago in Patna, has not conducted any significant public outreach programmes. With time ticking away, there is a lack of clarity on when the bloc will finalise the allocation of seats among its member parties. 




   Nitish Kumar played a pivotal role in the INDIA bloc, a coalition of 28 opposition parties. His exit shortly before the Lok Sabha elections in 2024 is anticipated to have repercussions on the alliance. Nitish Kumar, while announcing his resignation and the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly on Sunday, cited that the situation arose because ‚Äúnot everything was alright.""    




   JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi attributed the breakdown of the INDIA bloc in Bihar to the Congress, stating that Congress leaders prioritised strengthening their party over the opposition grouping, as conveyed to ANI. Tyagi had even accused a section of the Congress leadership of repeatedly ""insulting"" Nitish Kumar.    However, after Kumar's exit, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut claimed, ‚ÄúThe Congress was in favour of appointing Nitish as the convenor of the INDIA bloc.""  All is 'not' well with the rest of the parties?Trinamool Congress (TMC)Nitish Kumar's exit marks the second setback for the INDIA alliance, coming in the wake of recent developments in West Bengal, including the announcement by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee chose to break ties with the Congress and opt for an independent path in the upcoming Lok Sabha election in the state, just a day before Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was set to begin in the state.    Also Read: Mamata Banerjee blames Congress for seat-sharing delay over ‚Äòunjust‚Äô demands, Rahul says ‚ÄòBengal CM close to‚Ä¶‚Äô    The rift between the TMC and the Congress escalated as state unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury persistently criticised the Bengal chief minister. During a press conference on Tuesday, Adhir Chowdhury asserted that Mamata Banerjee attained power in the 2011 elections thanks to the support of the Congress party.  Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)The JD(U) chief's resignation occurred shortly after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab dismissed speculations about a seat-sharing agreement with the Congress in the state for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.    Also Read: No AAP alliance with Congress in Punjab for 2024 Lok Sabha polls: CM Bhagwant Mann    AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal stated on Sunday that his party would independently contest all 90 assembly seats in Haryana. However, he mentioned that the Lok Sabha elections would be contested as part of the INDIA bloc. Kejriwal's declaration follows the recent decision by AAP, a member of the INDIA bloc, to rule out any alliance with the Congress in Punjab for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha polls.  Samajwadi Party (SP)The Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) expressed dissatisfaction with the allocation of 18 seats offered by the Samajwadi Party (SP) to the two INDIA bloc allies in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing arrangement for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The SP proposed 11 seats for the Congress and seven seats for the RLD in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.    The Congress is insisting on receiving at least the 22 seats it secured in 2009, while the RLD is seeking eight seats in the politically significant state, which comprises a total of 80 Lok Sabha constituencies.    Discontent with the seats allocated by the SP, a senior leader told PTI that the RLD conveyed that the party is seeking an additional seat. However, Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X that the party's cordial alliance with the Congress is off to a ‚Äúgood start"".

Sonia Gandhi is the sole Congress Member of Parliament from the state, representing the Rae Bareli constituency. The Apna Dal (Sonelal) has secured two Lok Sabha seats, while the BJP has 64 seats in the state.    Opposition leaders have expressed doubts regarding the Congress party's choice to opt out of the alliance collaboration in the state elections. Omar Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and a prominent leader of a regional party in the state, remarked that the Congress only ‚Äúremembered the I.N.D.I.A. alliance after three months.""    Earlier on July 18, led by Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress party, 26 opposition parties rebranded themselves as INDIA, standing for the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, replacing their previous name UPA or United Progressive Alliance.    The outcome of the parliamentary coalition against the BJP, the current ruling party, in the 2024 general elections remains uncertain.

Hemant Soren faces ED probe: Jharkhand CM arrives in Ranchi amid ‚Äòmissing‚Äô allegations from BJP,"Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren arrived at his residence in Ranchi on Tuesday amid intense political activity around the leader. The officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), who were supposed to question him in the money laundering case claimed that they failed to locate the JMM leader. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared that the chief minister is ""missing"" and is ‚Äúon the run"" from a federal agency. 







    After reaching his residence in Ranchi, Hemant Soren said he was ready to depose before the ED on Wednesday at 1:00 p.m.¬† 




   The ED reached his Delhi residence on Monday to question the leader, but couldn't find him there. The probe agency then seized his BMW car and  ‚Çπ36 lakh in cash and claimed that they had found ""incriminating"" documents after it searched the Delhi house of the Jharkhand chief minister.¬†        The Opposition BJP alleged that the chief minister is ‚Äúon the run"" from the ED probe and even announced  ‚Çπ11,000 on credible information leading to his arrest. Governor CP Radhakrishnan had mentioned that he is closely monitoring the situation. ""It is the job of the Governor, I am doing it. We will cross the bridge when it comes,"" he said.    In the interim, instructions have been given for all Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) belonging to the ruling coalition, which includes the JMM, the Congress, and the RJD, to remain in Ranchi, giving rise to conjecture about the subsequent developments.

"Land-for-jobs scam: PMLA court summons former Bihar CM Rabri Devi, daughter Misa Bharti","A PMLA court has issued a summon for Amit Katyal, former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, Misha Bharti, Hema Yadav, and Hridyanand Chaudhary, instructing their presence on February 9, 2024, to proceed with the trial related to the purported ‚Äòland for job scam‚Äô, Enforcement Directorate (ED) stated in an official release. 







    Earlier on January 1, 2024, the ED lodged a prosecution complaint (PC) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, against Amit Katyal, Rabri Devi, Misha Bharti, Hema Yadav, Hridyanand Chaudhary, and two companies - A K Infosystems Private Limited and A B Exports Pvt. Ltd.

   Amit Katyal, a businessman allegedly linked to former Bihar chief minister and RJD patriarch Lalu Yadav's family members, is reportedly under scrutiny. The investigations were initiated by the central agency following an FIR filed by the CBI regarding the ‚Äòland for job scam.‚Äô    The allegations suggest that Lalu Yadav, who was the Railway Minister at the time, engaged in corrupt practices concerning the appointment of Group D substitutes in Indian Railways between 2004 and 2009.    Also Read: Bihar news: Lalu Prasad Yadav appears before ED for questioning in land-for-jobs scam case    According to the FIR, candidates were instructed to transfer land as a bribe to secure jobs in Indian Railways, and a charge sheet has been filed by the CBI in this regard.

Hridyanand Chaudhary, also implicated in the prosecution complaint, had previously worked at Rabri Devi's gaushala and allegedly obtained property from one of the candidates. Subsequently, this property was transferred to Hema Yadav.    The companies in question, A K Infosystems Private Limited and A B Exports Pvt. Ltd, are described as shell companies that purportedly received the proceeds of crime intended for family members of Lalu Prasad Yadav.    The ED said that the immovable properties were allegedly obtained by frontmen in the mentioned companies, following which shares were transferred to family members of Lalu Prasad Yadav at nominal prices.

He said, ‚ÄúIt has been seven months. Nothing has happened."" 







    ‚ÄúIn last meeting, our chairperson (Mamata Banerjee) gave a deadline of 31st December. Now it's 29th of January.

""According to alliance norms, the first thing you do is seal the seat-sharing. We had waited for eight months to seal the seat-sharing issue. But the Congress was sitting idle and nothing moved forward,"" Abhishek Banerjee was quoted by PTI as saying.

BJP-JD(S) clash with Congress in Karnataka as row over removal of Hanuman flag intensifies,"The removal of a saffron flag bearing Lord Hanuman's image has triggered an extensive political row in Karnataka. The BJP and JD(S) staged protests against the ruling party on Monday with several politicians accusing the Siddaramaiah-led government of failing to handle the situation. The Congress meanwhile insists that the flag was removed as permission was only sought to hoist the national Tricolour and the Karnataka State flag. 







    Former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy accused the government of playing politics on the issue, and instigating the people by using police force to quell the public unrest. He also took to Twitter on Monday evening to share photos from a two-party protest in Mandya over the removal of ‚ÄòHanuman dwaja‚Äô in Keragodu village. 




   ‚ÄúYou claim to have administrative experience, having presented 14 budgets (in the state assembly). If you have even a bit of administrative knowledge, set right your government's mistakes first,"" he urged the CM.        ‚ÄúInstead of accusing (opposition parties) of doing politics, set things right. It is not us (opposition) who are doing things keeping the Lok Sabha polls in mind‚Ä¶If they don't set things right, they will not be able to walk on the streets,"" he added.  ALSO READ: Hanuman flag row: Police detain BJP workers in Bengaluru; situation in Karnataka village tense | 10 key points to knowProtesters marched from Keragodu to the to the Deputy Commissioner's office in the district headquarters of Mandya holding saffron flags amid chants of ‚ÄúJai Sri Ram"" on Monday. Key politicians from both parties ‚Äî including BJP leaders CT Ravi and Preetham Gowda as well as former JD(S) MLAs Suresh Gowda, CS Puttaraju and K Annadani ‚Äî were part of the contingent. The group was seen raising slogans against the Congress government as they walked.    BJP leaders and workers also held protests at the district headquarters, condemning the ""anti-Hindu policy"" of the Congress government and accusing it of ""insulting"" the national flag.    Earlier on Monday, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had accused the BJP and JD(S) of trying to instigate people with an eye on the Lok Sabha elections.  ALSO READ: Karnataka Hanuman flag row: CM Siddaramaiah defends the move amid protestA row broke out in Keragodu after authorities removed the 'Hanuma dwaja' from a 108-ft-tall flag post on Sunday. Mandya District in-charge Minister N Cheluvarayaswamy had said the flagpole's location falls under the panchayat's jurisdiction, and permission was obtained to hoist the national flag, which was done on Republic Day, ""but it was replaced by another flag that evening"".

Foreign secretary Kwatra visits Bhutan as new government takes office,"New Delhi: Foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra began a three-day visit to Bhutan on Monday, a day after newly-elected Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay assumed office. The visit holds significance as the new government prepares to tackle the complex task of negotiating a border settlement with China.¬† 







    During his visit, Kwatra is scheduled to meet with King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk and Prime Minister Tsobgay, along with other high-ranking Bhutanese officials, including the foreign minister. 




   In 2021, Bhutan and China agreed to a three-step roadmap to address their unresolved border dispute. This roadmap involves delineating the border on maps, followed by surveys and formal demarcation, according to some observers. Progress in these border talks has been relatively swift, with the establishment of technical teams and the 25th round of border talks held in August and October 2023, respectively.        The resolution of the border issue is expected to pave the way for formal diplomatic relations between Bhutan and China. Bhutan, which has faced economic challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic and labour outflows, stands to benefit from potential Chinese investments.    On the other hand, India closely monitors these border negotiations, particularly in the context of the Doklam tri-junction, where past standoffs have occurred. Bhutan has been a longstanding diplomatic ally of India and has faced increasing pressure from China to settle the boundary dispute.    Both Bhutan and India maintain open communication regarding the progress of talks between Thimpu and Beijing. Bhutan's King made two visits to India in 2023, holding multiple high-level meetings. India has reaffirmed its support for Bhutan's five-year plans and the hydropower sector, emphasizing the strong bilateral ties between the two nations.

"'This is wrong': Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Nitish Kumar's political somersault, says ‚Äò‚Ä¶not good for democracy‚Äô","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday disparaged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for his political flip-flop to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after dumping the INDIA bloc. 







    The Aam Aadmi Party chief said Nitish Kumar didn't do the right thing by exiting the INDIA bloc. He also said that the JDU chief's conduct is not good for democracy. 




   ""I feel this is wrong and he should not have left. Such conduct is not good for democracy,"" Kejriwal said at a press conference responding to a question on Nitish Kumar forming a new government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar.        On Sunday, Nitish Kumar took oath as the Bihar chief minister for the ninth time. The development has come after he broke ties with the INDIA bloc and ‚ÄòMahagathbandhan‚Äô and joined the NDA to form a government with the BJP.¬†    After dumping the INDIA bloc, Nitish Kumar said, ""Things were not working well"" for him in the 'Mahagathbandhan' or the grand alliance. He returned to the BJP-led NDA and formed a new government, which he had dumped less than 18 months ago.    Now dismantled, Mahagathbandhan consisted of political parties including JD (U), RJD, Congress, and Left parties. The AAP is part of the INDIA bloc and is in seat-sharing talks with the Congress for five states -- Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat, Goa, and Haryana.    On Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal announced that his party will contest alone in all 90 seats in the Haryana assembly elections. He also clarified that he will contest together with the INDIA alliance in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.    ""For the upcoming Lok Sabha elections we will contest elections together with the INDIA alliance but for the assembly elections, we will contest alone on all 90 seats of Haryana by itself,"" Kejriwal said.    ""Today, the AAP is the largest group in Haryana compared to other political parties like the Congress, the BJP, and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP). There is a committee of 15-20 people in every village and ward. There are nearly 1.25 lakh office-bearers of the party in Haryana. This has been achieved in the last six months,"" Kejriwal added.

"BJP using CBI, ED to threaten people to get votes in Lok Sabha polls, says Mamata Banerjee","West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of threatening people to send probe agencies to their homes if they do not vote for the saffron party in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. 







    Mamata Banerjee also asserted that she will not follow any diktat of the BJP to worship any particular god. 




   ‚ÄúI follow Ramayana, Quran, Bible and Guru Granth Sahib... I do not do drama by visiting poor people's homes to eat food brought from outside,"" the West Bengal chief minister said during a public distribution programme in Cooch Behar.        She advised locals in Cooch Behar, particularly Rajbanshis, to ensure that their names are on the voters‚Äô list to ‚Äúprotect themselves"" from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.    ‚ÄúThe BJP is using central agencies for elections... it is threatening people over the phone to send Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths to their homes if they do not vote for the saffron party,"" Mamata Banerjee said.    She also alleged that the Centre is bringing up the issue of CAA to do politics before the Lok Sabha polls.¬†    ‚ÄúWe have fought against the NRC. Rajbanshis are citizens of India. They have again started shouting CAA, CAA for the sake of votes,"" the CM said.    Her¬†remarks came after Union minister Shantanu Thakur said on Sunday that the CAA will be implemented across the country in a week.¬†    The West Bengal CM said that her government has acknowledged all colonies as ‚Äúpermanent addresses"",¬† and all residents who get the benefit of various state government benefits are citizens of the country. ‚ÄúAll of you are citizens. We have given permanent addresses to all colonies. They get ration, go to school, get scholarships, get Kisan Bandhu, Shikhashree, Oikoshree, Laxmir Bhandar. How could they get these benefits if they had not been citizens? Had they been able to cast votes if they were not citizens?"" she asked.

"Uttarakhand govt to get UCC Committee's report on Feb 2, Assembly session on 5 Feb: What to expect?","Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said on Monday that the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Committee's report will be delivered to the state government on February 2. The statement came after a Uttarakhand minister suggested that there could be a debate on the draft of the UCC during the state assembly session ‚Äî set to be held from February 5 to February 8. 







    In his latest statement on Monday, Dhami told ANI, ""While making a promise to the people of the state in the 2022 assembly elections, we constituted the UCC Committee, taking a pledge to implement the Uniform Civil Code in the state. The committee has completed its work and on February 2, it will submit its report to us."" 




 What will happen next?The Uttarakhand Chief Minister further said that after receiving the report on February 2, it will be brought to the Uttarakhand Cabinet. After that, action will be taken in the state assembly to enact the Uniform Civil Code Act.      What is expected from the UCC Act?The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) proposes a common set of laws dealing with a range a issues, including marriage, inheritance, adoption and gender equality for every citizen in India. Article 44 of the Constitution of India says that the state shall endeavour to secure a UCC throughout the territory of India.  On the same lines, Uttarakhand's UCC Act may include:  1. Provisions that treat men and women equally in issues relating to inheritance.  2. The UCC may reject the practices of polygamy, iddat, and halal.  3. The minimum age for marriage for both men and women may remain the same as it was previously (18 years for women and 21 years for men), the Indian Express reported.    However, News 18 reported last year that the age limit of girls for marriage might be increased in the UCC structure. It added that Graduation is likely to be made mandatory before marriage so that the age limit will be increased automatically - from 18 years to 21 years.  4. Marriage registration might be made necessary. People might not avail the benefit of government schemes without registration of marriage.  ALSO READ: Income tax: How Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India will impact HUF (Hindu Undivided Families) tax outgo  5. The UCC may also regulate live-in relationships and require a mandatory declaration to start and terminate live-in relationships. The provisions might also include that parents must be informed for the live-in relationship.  6. Provisions might be included to provide both husband and wife equal grounds for divorce. The basis of divorce will be applied to both the husband and wife, not one party will have an upper hand, News 18 had reported.  7. The guardianship process might become easier if the child is an orphan  8. The number of children to a couple can be fixed. Everyone might be granted the right to adopt - irrespective of religion, gender etc  What PM Modi says on UCCPrime Minister Narendra Modi said the country cannot run on two laws and that the Uniform Civil Code was in keeping with the founding principles and ideals of the Constitution.    ""Today, people are being instigated in the name of the UCC. How can the country run on two (laws)? The Constitution also talks of equal rights...Supreme Court has also asked to implement the UCC. These (opposition) people are playing vote bank politics,"" PM Modi was quoted by ANI as saying.  What critics say about UCCCongress leader Harish Rawat had said, ""If different states have different UCCs, the very purpose of having a common law for all sections of society across the country will be defeated.""

Bihar politics: Prashant Kishor calls Nitish Kumar 'sardar of palturams'; predicts JD(U)'s fate in 2025 elections,"Political strategist and former JD(U) leader Prashant Kishor on Sunday said that not just Nitish Kumar, but all politicians in Bihar are ‚Äòpalturams.‚Äô Prashant Kishor asserted that in the past year, he was the only leader to openly claim that Nitish Kumar would change sides anytime and the Bihar Chief Minister is a ""sardar of palturams."" The Jan Suraaj Abhiyan leader also predicted the fate of Nitish Kumar's JD(U) in the Bihar assembly elections 2025. 







  Bihar politics LIVE: Nitish Kumar to take oath as Bihar CM for record 9th time""If you look back at my remarks over the past year, then you would find out that I was the only person who on camera said that Nitish Kumar can change his side anytime. People already know that Nitish Kumar is a 'palturam' and 'sardar of palturams'. However, today's incident has shown that all politicians in Bihar are also 'palturam',"" Prashant Kishor said as per PTI. 




 Prashant Kishor said that the political equations in Bihar will undergo a substantial change ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 and the developments will be more dramatic.        ""In the present Bihar picture, there are two sides. On one hand, Nitish Kumar is the face, supported by the BJP. On the other, there is RJD and the other parties. The Bihar assembly election will not take place in this formation. Before the next Bihar election, there will be many dramatic developments in Bihar. Within six months after the Lok Sabha election, you will see those developments,"" Prashant Kishor said.  'Will take retirement if JD(U) gets more than 20 seats'The political strategist, who is a well-known force behind many successful politicians in India said that Nitish Kumar left Mahgathbandhan as he got scared of his prediction. Prashant Kishor said that in case JD(U) gets more than 20 seats in the 2025 Bihar assembly elections, he will take retirement.    ""They got scared after my prediction and already left Mahgathbandhan. My next prediction is Nitish Kumar's party won't get more than 20 seats in the state election. Please write it down. If JD(U) gets more than 20 seats in the state, I will take retirement,"" Prashant Kishor said.    ¬†

Nitish Kumar may take oath as Bihar CM on Sunday with BJP support: Report,"JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar is likely to take oath as Bihar Chief Minister with BJP's support, NDTV said in a report. 







    Mint could not independently verify the report. 




   Rumours have strife that Kumar is likely to join hands with PM Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid his deepening differences with INDIA bloc allies.      Is Nitish Kumar returning to NDA? A guide to what's happening in Bihar politics    On Thursday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah held meetings with Bihar BJP president Samrat Choudhary and other senior leaders from the state, including Sushil Modi and Vijay Kumar Sinha in Delhi as the buzz grew that they are open to welcoming Kumar back into their fold.    Bihar's longest-serving chief minister has been cut up with the INDIA bloc for not getting a position in the alliance commensurate with his stature and also favours an early assembly poll to go with the Lok Sabha elections.  INDIA ally Nitish Kumar may return to NDA, but conditions apply: Report    In fact, the INDIA bloc has been marred by incoherence and distrust, with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann dealing double blows on Wednesday that their parties, the TMC and AAP respectively, will go solo in the Lok Sabha elections expected in April-May.    Signs of disconnect among the INDIA parties in Bihar will suit the BJP in the run-up to the elections as the same alliance had handed it a big defeat in the 2015 assembly polls before Kumar joined hands again with the BJP-led NDA, which then swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.    Kumar vaulted into the opposition's alliance in 2022 as the BJP grew increasingly assertive following his party's sub-par performance in the 2020 assembly polls.    Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has returned to the national capital amid tension with Kumar, and the INDIA bloc has erupted.    Gandhi has temporarily paused the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and will resume on January 28 from Cooch Behar, West Bengal.

"Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi will be delighted if Mamata Banerjee joins Nyay Yatra: Jairam Ramesh","Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday spoke with West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee today. ""We will find a way forward,"" said Jairam Ramesh amid the Congress-TMC alliance impasse. 







    ""Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi will be delighted if Mamata Banerjee joins Nyay Yatra in West Bengal even if it's for few minutes,"" Jairam Ramesh said ¬†further.¬† 




   ""Congress president Kharge has spoken with her today and we will find a way forward because her objective is the objective of the INDIA bloc which is to defeat the BJP resoundingly in West Bengal and convincingly in other parts of the country,"" he said.        Ramesh said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would be immensely strengthened by her presence.    ""Without her, we cannot fight the BJP in Bengal and the rest of the country. She is the integral, essential pillar of the opposition bloc INDIA. She has played a crucial role in making the INDIA bloc a reality,"" the Congress leader said.    Ramesh's remarks came after Gandhi expressed confidence in the unity of the opposition INDIA bloc in combating injustice nationwide.    The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Gandhi, entered West Bengal on Thursday from Assam through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district. It will take a two-day break on January 26-27 before restarting on January 28.    Banerjee had told reporters on Wednesday, ""I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go it alone in Bengal.""    After Banerjee's sudden comments, the Congress has adopted a conciliatory approach with Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee"".    The CPI (M)-led Left Front, Congress, and the TMC are part of the 28-party INDIA bloc.    In the 2019 elections, the TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and the BJP bagged 18 seats in the state.

"Lok Sabha polls: BJP invites suggestions for manifesto; Indians demand 'GST on fuel, jobs...'","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched its poll campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha Election 2024 with a new slogan, ""Modi ko chunte hai"" (let us choose Prime Minister Narendra Modi). The prime minister also inaugurated multiple development projects worth over  ‚Çπ19,100 crore in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr. But there's more to the BJP's poll campaign. 







    The BJP government, which believes in building an inclusive India, has made attempts to make its 2024 Lok Sabha poll campaign participatory. The political party has sought suggestions from the public to formulate its poll manifesto ahead of elections. ""Your inputs will shape BJP's 2024 election manifesto,"" the BJP's poster read. 




   In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""I invite the youth of India to contribute to the BJP Manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections."" He asked the youth to share their thoughts on the NaMo App.        As part of the initiative, the prime minister said he would also meet ""some of the contributors"" in person and discuss the inputs shared.




   ""Public participation in the political process strengthens a sense of collaboration between the government and the people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged citizens to contribute their suggestions and inputs for the BJP's election manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" one of the blog posts by PM Modi said.    Apart from the NaMo app, people can also share their suggestions in the comment section of the blog post.  What people demanded in first few hours of the campaignSeveral people responded in the comment section of the PM Modi's blog post. One person suggested, ""Incentives for population control and strict norms for more than two children"". Another demanded, ""Education and employment"".    Some others sought ""better health facilities"", while another comment read, ""Agriculture is very important for our Country.. there should be some plans to encourage agriculture, Farming and Farmers to benefit from this"". In a separate comment, a person said, ""We need to take steps for homeless, jobless people without any partiality. Day by day poor make more poor. We need to take more attention (sic).""    There were also demands for ""increase (in) solar subsidies"", ""preserve(ing) the heritage of our country"", ""Chinese-level economic progress"", ""Population control bill, CAA implementation, rojgar (employment) in rural areas"", ""to revise income tax slab need to reduce petrol, diesel and cylinder price"", ""increase tax slab limit"" and ""Increase Judiciary system people intake to clear pending cases"".    Meanwhile, a person shared a list mentioning: ""1. UCC (Uniform Civil Code) implementation 2. Police Reform 3. RTO Reform 4. Land Mafia Removal and Management 5. Kashi & Mathura Temple 6. Faster Trains & Train timing management 7. Creating more jobs and entrepreneurship 8. PoK takeover 9. Better facilities at tourist places 10. More roads 11. Population control law"".¬†    Another suggested bringing petrol and diesel under the GST, ""strict law on freebies to be followed by every state"" and ""financial knowledge in school"".  BJP campaign songLaunching its poll campaign earlier in the day, the BJP released the theme song in a 2-minute, 10-second video, ""Sapne Nahi Haqeeqat Bunte Hai, Tabhi Toh Sab Modi Ko Chunte Hai"" (We don't weave dreams but reality, and that's why everyone chooses Modi).¬†    The campaign was launched at the First Time Voters Conclave, NaMo Navmatdata Sammelan.    The music video showcased how PM Modi has turned the dreams and aspirations of crores of Indians into reality. The campaign song mentioned that India's situation was deplorable and then the country chose NaMo (Narendra Modi) as the PM.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/lok-sabha-election-2024-bjp-invites-suggestions-public-youth-for-manifesto-indians-demand-gst-on-fuel-jobs-tax-slab-11706182714893.html
"INDIA ally Nitish Kumar may return to BJP-led NDA, but conditions apply: Report","Speculations are rife that Bihar Chief Minister and INDIA bloc ally Nitish Kumar might return to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India Today cited BJP sources as saying on Thursday that the saffron party has set a condition for the JD(U) chief if he wants to return to the alliance. And that condition is that Nitish Kumar must quit as the chief minister, sources said. 







    Meanwhile, Jan Ki Baat, which predicts elections through opinion and exit polls, also cited sources as saying that Nitish Kumar is set to return to the NDA and is currently mulling legal options to dissolve the state assembly. Earlier in the day, sources told NDTV that Nitish Kumar might not join the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra', led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, when it enters his state on January 29. 




   Besides this, Zee News reported that Nitish Kumar may get a place at the Centre.¬†        A series of meetings are reportedly being held in Patna. Times Now reported that JDU leaders will be holding a meeting at Nitish Kumar's house, while RJD leaders are holding a separate meeting at Lalu Yadav's house. Sources told the media house that ‚Äúsenior leaders of the BJP have also been called to Delhi, and Sushil Modi is going to meet Home Minister Amit Shah tonight.""    Amid reports, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said, ""As a BJP worker, I can say that the door to enter into our party is closed for Nitish Kumar. He is an unreliable politician.""    ¬†




 Nitish Kumar, a key figure in the INDIA coalition, switched from the BJP two years ago. JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said on Thursday that Nitish Kumar had appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for awarding 'Bharat Ratna' to Karpoori Thakur.    He told ANI, ‚ÄúNitish Kumar ji appreciated the way Karpoori Thakur did not give MLA ticket to his own son. He also appreciated the PM for awarding 'Bharat Ratna' to Karpoori Thakur."" Nitish Kumar had earlier rejected the post of convenor of the INDIA bloc, as per ANI sources.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/india-ally-nitish-kumar-to-return-to-nda-but-conditions-apply-report-11706177534815.html
"AAP, Congress workers in Chandigarh make a shift to BJP ahead of Lok Sabha polls","In a blow to the INDIA bloc, several Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress members led by Arvind Kejriwal joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Chandigarh on Thursday in preparation for the impending Lok Sabha elections.¬† 







    The formal induction of these workers took place at a ceremony held at the party office in Chandigarh. 




   Former Member of Parliament Ashok Tanwar resigned from the primary membership of the Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday. He cited his decision to the alignment of AAP with the Indian National Congress for the Chandigarh Mayor elections.        Also Read: AAP leader Ashok Tanwar resigns from party, says ‚Äòyour alignment with Congress‚Ä¶'    In his resignation letter to AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal he said, ‚ÄúIn view of the current political scenario and your alignment with the Indian National Congress, my ethics won't allow me to continue as Chairman, Election Campaign Committee, Aam Aadmi Party Haryana.

This decision sparked protests from both the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, who had formed an alliance for the mayoral elections.    Earlier on January 18, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the cancellation of mayor polls scheduled to be held in Chandigarh on Thursday.    The AAP and Congress accused the BJP of not allowing to hold the mayoral polls in the wake of its ‚Äúimminent defeat"" and also said that they would move the Punjab and Haryana High Court to hold the elections.

Sena Vs Sena: Uddhav Thackeray faction moves SC against Maharashtra Speaker's verdict on disqualification plea,"Uddhav Thackeray's faction of the Shiv Sena moved the Supreme Court on Monday against the Maharashtra Speaker's order rejecting the plea to disqualify MLAs of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's faction, PTI reported. In his verdict last week, Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar had rejected the disqualification petitions filed by both the camps. He also ruled that the faction led by Shinde was the ""real Shiv Sena political party when rival factions emerged on 21st June 2022"". 

















   Uddhav Thackrey and leaders from his camp, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), criticised Narwekar for the verdict and accused him of colluding with Eknath Shinde. Thackeray had earlier raised objection to a meeting between Narwekar and Shinde, just ahead of the verdict in the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification case.¬†        Uddhav Thackeray said the Speaker's verdict was in violation of the Supreme Court order and is a ""ploy to kill democracy"". ¬†He said, ""The way he made Narvekar sit, it was clear that he was in collusion. I had expressed my doubts yesterday that this is a ploy to kill democracy... We will see whether a case of contempt of the Supreme Court can be made out or not.""¬†    According to PTI, the Shiv Sena (UBT) also accused the Maharashtra Speaker of acting like Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's lawyer while giving his ruling on disqualification petitions filed by the warring Sena factions. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is all match-fixing"".    However, Narvekar dismissed the allegation of ""match-fixing"" as ""baseless"" and said he has to perform his other duties being an MLA and member of a legislative board. He said, ‚ÄúThere's no provision under law that says that while the Speaker is adjudicating disqualification petitions, he should not perform his other duties.""    Narvekar even hit out at Uddhav Thackeray's decision to approach the Supreme Court. He said, ‚Äú...just because you approach the court does not mean that the order passed by the Speaker is overturned."" He added that one has ""to establish that it (the verdict) is illegal or untenable in the eyes of the law."" And, the Uddhav Thackeray faction's ""baseless allegations do not substantiate that,"" the Maharashtra Speaker said on January 10.

Why is PM Modi in a hurry to inaugurate Ram Temple? Congress hits out at BJP for ‚Äònot listening‚Äô to Shankaracharyas,"Congress leader Pawan Khera has hit out at ‚Äúthekedar"" Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) for conducting the ‚ÄòPran Prathista‚Äô ceremony in an incomplete Ayodhya Ram Mandir. After four Shankaracharya (religious heads) refused to attend the Ram Temple inauguration in Ayodhya, Congress hit out at BJP commenting ‚Äòwhy are they in a hurry to inaugurate an under-construction building‚Äô. 







    ‚ÄúAll four Shankaracharyas have said clearly that the pranpratishtha of an incomplete temple cannot be done. If this event is not religious, then it is political"", Pawan Khera said.¬† 








       Shankaracharyas cited that the event is not happening adhering to scriptural guidelines for the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony    Taking a jibe at the BJP, Congress leader Alka Lamba, ""Ask them (BJP), why are the Shankaracharyas not going (to attend the Pran Pratishtha ceremony). They said that construction of Ram Mandir is incomplete, why are the BJP and PM in a hurry? Inaugurating the temple while it is under construction and politicising it; it is evident because elections are nearing.""    On a similar note, Karnataka Congress leader Priyank Kharge questioned, ""The four Shankaracharyas and saints are saying that the Ram temple is incomplete. Why is BJP seeking answers from Congress, but not listening to what the Shankaracharyas are saying?""    Meanwhile, Congress party's Chairperson Social Media & Digital Platforms Supriya Shrinate says, ""All four Shankaracharyas have decided to not visit Ayodhya (for pranpratishtha of Ram Temple). But there is no outrage over this. Does this not hurt religion? It is absolutely wrong to do politics over religious rituals. We are not declining a visit (to Ayodhya). We are not going to the 22nd January event in Ayodhya that is being held in the presence of PM Modi and RSS chief. Shankaracharyas are not going to that event either.

    ""Voters don‚Äôt like being taken for granted ‚Äî but can this arrogant ruling party ever understand that?"" Tharoor said in a post on X on Monday. 




   Congress candidate Rupinder Singh Kooner won the Karanpur by-election in Rajasthan on Monday. He defeated Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and Rajasthan minister Surenderpal Singh.        Surendra Pal Singh is the Rajasthan minister in-charge of four departments ‚ÄîAgricultural Marketing, Agricultural Educator, Indira Gandhi Canal Department and Minority Affairs.    ¬†




   As per the Election Commission of India, after the final round of counting, Kooner garnered a total of 94,950 votes (48.55 per cent), while the BJP minister got 83,667 votes (42.78 per cent).    ""The stunning victory of Congress candidate Shri Rupinder Singh Kunnar in the ShriKaranpur by-election in Rajasthan ‚Äî over a BJP candidate who had already been anointed as a Minister in the state cabinet ‚Äî is a portent of things to come,"" Tharoor said.    Former Rajasthan Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot also expressed his satisfaction over the Congress triumph in the Karanpur Assembly constituency in Rajasthan.    ""This election has given several messages...The arrogance of BJP and the manner in which they have abandoned morality...it is like a slap by the people to BJP."" Ashok Gehlot said.    He extended congratulations to Rupinder Singh for his victory in Karanpur and said, ""Hearty congratulations and best wishes to Shri Rupinder Singh Kunar, the Congress candidate. This triumph is a tribute to the public service initiatives of the late Gurmreet Singh Kunar.""    The election for Karanpur was postponed due to the death of Congress candidate and sitting MLA Gurmeet Singh Koonar. The Congress then fielded his son Rupinder Singh Koonar from the seat.    In the Rajasthan Assembly Election 2023, the BJP won 115 seats, whereas Congress formed the opposition in the state with 68 seats.

"AAP-Congress seat-sharing formula: Kejriwal's party offers 3 Delhi seats for 1 in Gujarat, 3 in Haryana, says report","Ahead of Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are working to come up with a seat-sharing formula for key states including Delhi and Punjab. The two parties held a meeting for the same on Monday.¬† 







    The meeting was attended by senior Congress leaders Mukul Wasnik and Ashok Gehlot, members of the seat-sharing committee, AAP leader Sandeep Pathak, and Delhi Cabinet ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj. In addition to Wasnik and Gehlot, Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely and senior party leaders Salman Khurshid and Mohan Prakash also took part. 




   Even though there has been no official announcement about the seat sharing by the two parties, several media reports suggested that the AAP is offering three Lok Sabha seats from Delhi to the Congress. In return, the Arvind Kejriwal-led party is eyeing 1 Lok Sabha seat in Gujarat, 3 in Haryana, and 1 in Goa, reported India Today citing sources.        The Aam Aadmi Party claimed that the decision on seat sharing will come through further meetings. Earlier, PTI had reported citing sources that the AAP has expressed its willingness to contest the Lok Sabha polls in states such as Gujarat Haryana, and Goa.¬†  Several Congress leaders oppose tie-up with AAPAmid discussions between the two parties regarding the seat-sharing formula, the Congress is facing the opposition of its leaders against a tie-up with the AAP. Congress units in Delhi and Punjab are opposed to any truck with the AAP, according to the PTI report.    The AAP leaders remained tight-lipped over the deliberations. However, the sources said both sides discussed the seats they are willing to contest in Delhi.    The AAP wants to contest four of the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, whereas the Congress is willing to field its nominees from the New Delhi, Chandni Chowk, and North East constituencies, sources told PTI.    ""We had a very good meeting. Senior AAP leaders attended the meeting to hold discussions with us on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal. The National Alliance Committee (NAC) formed by the Congress president held discussions with the AAP leaders and a final decision will be taken later,"" Wasnik said after the meeting.    ""We had in-depth discussions regarding seat sharing and on various other topics. We will meet again after a few days and the final discussion on seat sharing will take place. We will give a final shape to the seat-sharing plans later. We will contest the election together with vigorous preparations and defeat the BJP,"" Wasnik, convenor of the Congress's NAC, said.

"Ayodhya Ram Mandir ceremony: 'I will never allow...,' says Mamata Banerjee","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of ""doing a gimmick"" before the Lok Sabha Elections. She said, ""Yesterday I was asked about Ram Mandir... I believe in a festival which takes everyone together, talks about everyone..."" 







    In a veiled attack on the BJP, Banerjee raised an objection over ""disregarding people of other communities"". She said, ""Do whatever you want, you are doing a gimmick before the elections, do it, I have no problem but disregarding people of other communities is not right.""

'Temple or hospital?': Bihar Education Minister Chandra Shekhar's remarks on Ram Mandir sparks outcry,"The Opposition INDIA alliance doesn't seem to have any idea on how to counter the massive popularity boost BJP is receiving ahead of the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on 22 January. While some leaders are tight-lipped on the event, others are resorting to counterattack. The Bihar politics is stirred by the recent poster of RJD MLA Fateh Bahadur Singh, which described temples as a ""path to mental slavery."" Bihar Education Minister Chandra Shekhar defended the poster on Monday and cautioned against pseudo-Hinduvaad and pseudo-nationalism. 







    ‚ÄúIf you get injured, where will you go? Temple or hospital? If you want education and want to become an officer, MLA, or MP, will you go to a temple or school? Fateh Bahadur Singh (RJD MLA) said the same thing that had been said by Savitribai Phule. What is wrong here? He quoted Savitribai Phule. Isn't education necessary?..."" Bihar Education Minister Chandra Shekhar said while speaking to ANI on Monday. 




   ""We should be cautious of pseudo-Hinduvaad and pseudo-nationalism...When Lord Ram resides in each one of us and everywhere, where will you go to look for him?...The sites that have been allocated have been made into sites of exploitation, used for filling the pockets of a few conspirators in society..."" the minister added.¬†    




 Fateh Bahadur Singh's mental slavery posterThe development comes as another Bihar leader and RJD MLA Fateh Bahadur Singh described temples as a path to ‚Äòmental slavery‚Äô in a poster. The poster coming ahead of the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony was not taken well by the opposition BJP, which claimed that the it was ‚Äúaimed at hurting Hindu sentiments with provocative remarks"".    ‚ÄúThe meaning of temple is the path to mental slavery, while the meaning of school is the path towards light,"" the poster said.¬†    ‚ÄúWhen the bell in the temple tolls, it gives us a message that we are heading towards superstition, hypocrisy, foolishness and ignorance; while the bell in the school points towards logical thinking, scientific approach and march towards light. It is for you to decide which way you want to head,"" the poster added.¬†

"‚ÄòThis is India‚Äôs moment‚Äô: PM Modi talks about his management style, says ‚Äòthe final destination‚Ä¶‚Äô","Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes that the ""latent potential"" of India has been unleased in recent years as the government eyes a $5 trillion economy. The senior politician touched upon a wide range of issues ‚Äì from his governance agenda to the ‚Äúroad ahead towards making India the world‚Äôs third largest economy"" during a recent media interaction. The remarks come even as the Narendra Modi-led government intensifies its efforts to secure a third tem in office during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. 







    ‚ÄúWhen I start something, I know the endpoint. But I never announce the final destination or blueprint in the beginning. So, what you see today is not what I‚Äôve worked on. A far bigger picture will unfold finally. I work on a big canvas. Like an artist, I start from one point, but at the time the final picture can‚Äôt be seen,"" the PM told India Today.¬† 




   The PM underscored his point using the Statue of Unity as an example. The 182-foot structure had faced flak from several quarters with many accusing the government of pandering tto a community ahead of polls.¬†        ‚ÄúBut see how it has developed into an entire tourism ecosystem, with something for people of all age groups and interests. Just a couple of days back, it saw 80,000 visitors in one day, this is the level of its popularity. I had promised only one thing, but I delivered dozens of things there. This is my working style,"" Modi added.    The BJP-led government, he explained, believed in ‚Äúachieving national goals through jan andolans"" and believed in the ‚Äúoptimum utilisation of resources and outcome-oriented monitoring"". Modi also said that he formulated policies and strategies after listening to ‚Äúall the economists and experts"" and then taking his ‚Äúground connect"" and the ‚Äúlived reality of India"" into account.

PM Modi appeared to concur, insisting that his track record over the past two decades ‚Äúspoke for itself"".    ¬†‚Äú‚Ä¶when I became PM in 2014, the size of India‚Äôs economy was $2 trillion ( ‚Çπ167 lakh crore) and at the end of 2023-24, India‚Äôs GDP will be more than $3.75 trillion ( ‚Çπ312 lakh crore). It is this track record of 23 years which shows this is a realistic target‚Ä¶Today, the world consensus is clear: this is India‚Äôs moment.,"" he added.    ¬†

When the debt on the farmers of the country is 60 per cent more than in 2014, then the Modi government has waived off the loans of industrialists Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 10 years. Private insurance companies, which withheld Rs 2700 crores of farmers' share in the crop insurance scheme, are themselves earning profits Rs 40,000 crores,"" he said.Rahul further emphasized that Congress aims to reduce the cost of agriculture and provide fair prices to the farmers for their crops.""Farmers are struggling even for MSP amid skyrocketing agricultural costs due to expensive fertilizers, expensive seeds, expensive irrigation and expensive electricity. Without proper MSP, farmers are incurring a loss of Rs 200 per quintal of wheat and Rs 680 per quintal of paddy,"" the Congress leader added.""Congress aims to reduce the cost of agriculture and provide fair price to the farmers for their crops because the path to prosperity of the farmers is their economic self-reliance and this is the real justice for them,' he added.Notably, yesterday Rahul Gandhi interacted with the farmers in Bihar's Purnia while his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra passed the state.""Our government will be a 'government of farmers', not of some 'government industrialists',"" Rahul said.

Buzz in Congress circles on Sonia Gandhi taking RS route to parliament,"New Delhi | Bengaluru: Congress circles are abuzz with a growing suspense on whether Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi will opt for a Rajya Sabha berth this time instead of contesting from Raebareli, which she has represented in the Lok Sabha since 2004.Budget 2024Budget at a glance: Your 2-minute guide to become a Budget ProWhile there is nothing official about it yet, many Gandhi family loyalists among the Congress leaders have started whispering that it's better the 77-year-old Gandhi avoid another Lok Sabha poll contest given her ""poor health"". Some of them also feel her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is best suited to contest and guard ""the Gandhi family seat"" of Raebareli (even though some Vadra campers have been pitching for Priyanka seeking an RS berth) while Rahul Gandhi can try to wrest Amethi with or without contesting from the second (safe) seat of Wayanad.It is also a fact that after BJP wrested Rahul's Amethi seat last time, the saffron party is working hard to storm Raebareli, the lone Congress sitting seat in UP, in the 2024 poll. Congress could win one RS seat each from Himachal, Rajasthan and Maharashtra and the party is in a position to win about 3-4 seats from Karnataka and Telangana. It remains to be seen whether the Congress circles will work the typical chorus for Sonia Gandhi's entry into the RS when nomination time approaches.Meanwhile, Karnataka PCC chief DK Shivakumar on Tuesday sought to put at rest talks of Gandhi entering the Rajya Sabha from the state and claimed there had been no such discussion.

"Land-for-jobs case after Prasad, ED questions son Tejashwi Yadav","New Delhi: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday questioned Bihar's former deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for nearly eight hours in its Patna office in the land-for-jobs case, a day after questioning his father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad for nearly 10 hours. The agency is set to file a supplementary charge sheet against them alleging their ""direct"" involvement in the case.

ED has alleged that Katyal is a close aide of Prasad and his family.The agency had earlier this month filed a charge sheet against former Bihar CM Rabri Devi, her MP daughter Misa Bharti and another daughter Hema Yadav in the same case.

"14 states, 150 days, 355 constituencies: Bharat Nyay Yatra is Rahul Gandhi's last chance to walk the talk before polls","After the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs decisive Assembly election victories in three Hindi-heartland states, the 2024 game is looking settled. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more than confident about getting a third tenure and is already making promises about his next stint at the top post. The Congress has to swallow some bitter pills, as the defeat reduces their leverage amongst other parties of the INDIA alliance. In his last chance to revive the fortunes of the Congress party ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is embarking on the second leg of his pan-India march, the ‚ÄòBharat Nyay Yatra‚Äô. 







    The Bharat Nyay Yatra comes as Rahul Gandhi received tremendous support for its ‚ÄòBharat Jodo Yatra‚Äô which the Congress MP started in September 2022 from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. This time Rahul Gandhi will undertake a 150-day-long Bharat Nyay Yatra from Manipur in the northeast to Mumbai in western India. 




   ‚ÄúThis Yatra will cover a distance of 6,200 km. It travels the states including Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, UP, MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat and finally Maharashtra. The mode of yatra is through the bus,"" Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal said while announcing the Bharat Nyay Yatra.      Bharat Nyay Yatra: The Lok Sabha calculusRahul Gandhi‚Äôs Bharat Nyay Yatra, which will conclude just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, seems to be a well-thought-out plan. It remains to be seen if the impact of this Yatra will convert into numbers, but the route of the march covers most of the Lok Sabha seats of North India, especially where the Congress has shown a disastrous performance in the previous two Lok Sabha elections.    The Congress leader will cover 14 states during the Bharat Nyay Yatra and it includes crucial states like West Bengal (42 Lok Sabha seats), Bihar (40 seats), Uttar Pradesh (80 seats), Madhya Pradesh (29 seats), Rajasthan (25 seats), Gujarat (26 seats) and Maharashtra (48 seats). The march will also include Chhattisgarh (11 seats) which the Congress recently lost to the BJP.    Overall, the Bharat Nyay Yatra will cover 355 Lok Sabha seats which is 65% of the total parliamentary seats in the country. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 236 of the 355 seats while the Congress managed to win only 14.  Bharat Nyay Yatra: The alliance managementApart from an attempt to regain its lost glory in the Hindi-heartland states, the Congress is also looking to send a message to the other parties of the INDIA alliance. Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Bharat Jodo Yatra was successful in attracting a huge crowd and hence more cameras. So, when the former Congress president gets that sort of media attention in West Bengal or Uttar Pradesh, its alliance partner may get a signal from the Congress asserting its support base in these states.    In the recently concluded meeting of the INDIA alliance, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee proposed the name of Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge as the prime minister candidate of the Opposition front. While some political pundits can‚Äôt stop themselves from calling it a move to sacrifice Mallikarjun Kharge in a no-brainer election, others still live in the La La Land of Congress making a comeback.

"‚Äò ‚Çπ40,000 crore scam': Karnataka BJP MLA vows to expose Covid corruption charges against BS Yediyurappa if‚Ä¶","Disgruntled Vijayapura BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal yet again lashed out at former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and accused him of a massive  ‚Çπ40,000 crore corruption in the COVID-19 management in the state.¬† 







    ""Do you know how many thousands of crores of rupees was looted in this (Covid)? There is  ‚Çπ40,000 crore irregularities during Covid-19 outbreak,"" Yatnal claimed, PTI reported. 




   As many BJP leaders have been demanding action against him, Yatnal said, ""They (the BJP government in Karnataka) have done everything (huge corruption during Covid). Let them serve me a notice and try to expel me from the party, I will expose them.""        ""A mask that costs  ‚Çπ45 each, Mr Yediyurappa how much did your government spend on each of them during Covid? They had put a price of  ‚Çπ485 for each mask...,"" the agitated BJP MLA said in Vijayapura.    ""They (BJP government) said they arranged 10,000 beds in Bengaluru. The rent for these beds...remember that it was taken only on rent‚Ä¶if they had purchased then two beds could have been bought (for the same price). They paid  ‚Çπ20,000 as rent per day. Two cots with saline stands could have been purchased with  ‚Çπ20,000. Do you know how much they spent a day during corona?"" Yatnal further said.    Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said Yatnal's statement was proof of large-scale corruption during Covid time.    He said the Congress when in the opposition had called a press conference and alleged with documents that the Yediyurappa government had committed corruption to the tune of around  ‚Çπ4,000 crore in the name of coronavirus treatment and control.  Covid: 34 cases of JN.1 variant in KarnatakaKarnataka Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao has said that there are 34 cases of JN.1 variant of COVID-19 in the state but the government is well prepared and nothing is ""alarming.""

"Ram Mandir is BJP‚Äôs ‚Äòshow-off‚Äô, says Kapil Sibal: Saffron party‚Äôs behaviour ‚Äònowhere close to Ram's‚Äô","Kapil Sibal recently spoke about his personal spirituality and views on current political events. The Rajya Sabha MP expressed his devotion to Lord Ram, stating that Ram's presence in his heart guides his actions and beliefs. 







    ""I have Ram in my heart. I don't need to show off. What I say to you is from my heart because I do not care about all these things. If Ram is in my heart and Ram has guided me throughout my journey, it means that I have done something right,"" Sibal told ANI.

Sibal emphasised that his faith is a personal matter, not requiring public display.        Sibal criticised the Centre's approach to the Ram Mandir construction. He labelled it as a ‚Äúshow-off"". He compared the BJP's actions with Lord Ram's qualities like honesty, tolerance and respect. According to him, while the saffron party praises Ram in public, their actions don't match Ram's teachings. He urged that Ram's principles should guide one's actions, reflecting in adherence to constitutional goals.

Kapil Sibal on criminal billsDiscussing recent criminal bills passed in Parliament, Sibal raised concerns about their nature and the process of their enactment.

"‚ÄòNo alternative to PM Narendra Modi in country as of now,‚Äô claims Ajit Pawar","Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said that currently, there is ‚Äúno alternative"" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the country. 







    As reported by PTI, Pawar's response came when reporters inquired about opposition parties contemplating a challenge to Modi's leadership in anticipation of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls next year. 




   ‚ÄúAs of now, there is no alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the country. Such a decision is taken based on various aspects and not just one or two things,"" Pawar said.        Also Read: NCP leader counters 'fiefdom' jibe from Ajit Pawar-led faction, says Sharad Pawar 'stood behind you like a rock'    ‚ÄúYou people do a lot of propaganda,"" he told the mediapersons.    Pawar further stressed, ‚ÄúBut questions like who will protect the country's interests, in whose hands the country will be safer and stronger, and who raised the country's image on the international stage, these factors matter a lot.""    Also Read: 'Ajit Pawar not our leader,' Sharad Pawar takes U-turn after 'no conflict, no split in party' remark    ""We have also seen results (of recent assembly polls) in three states - Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. A guesswork before the elections does not mean results will be the same,"" he said.    The BJP emerged victorious in the polls held in these three states.    In response to questions about opposition parties organizing rallies in the Pune district against the state government, Pawar mentioned that a Lok Sabha MP from the NCP had indicated his readiness to resign as a member of the Lower House of Parliament.    Also Read: 'PM Modi's charisma would benefit Maharashtra': Ajit Pawar amid speculations of joining Sharad Pawar    ‚ÄúWhen we gave him a ticket in 2019, he was popular because he played the role of Sambhaji Maharaj (in a TV serial) and was a good orator,"" he said apparently referring to Amol Kolhe, the Lok Sabha member from Shirur constituency in Pune who supports the NCP camp led by Sharad Pawar.    ""I have decided on an alternative to him (in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls), and I can tell you now that my candidate will win the seat for sure,"" said Ajit Pawar, who along with eight other NCP leaders joined the Eknath Shinde-led state government in July this year.

"No ‚Äònegative campaigning‚Äô, Ram Temple: How BJP is strategising a ‚Äòstunning‚Äô victory in 2024 LS polls. 10 things to know","After a stupendous victory in assembly polls in 3 states - Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, BJP has set its sights on winning an ""unprecedented majority"" in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.¬† 







    Keeping this as the vision, in a recent meeting, senior BJP leaders, including Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi, chalked out key strategies ahead of the elections.¬† 




   During the meeting, PM Modi urged key organisational leaders to work towards boosting the party's vote share by 10%, while Home Minister Amit Shah said that the BJP's performance should leave the opposition ‚Äústunned"".        ""We have to reach every home with our ideology and historic works of BJP governments and make Modi ji prime minister again in 2024 with an unprecedented majority,"" Shah later posted on X about his address at the meet.  Here are the key things discussed during the meeting:Modi called for raising the BJP's vote share by 10% from its show in the 2019 polls when the ruling party had fetched over 37% of votes while the National Democratic Alliance led by it had bagged around 45% votes.The party's top brass did not set any specific seat target but emphasised on ensuring a win which should be bigger than its 2019 performance when the BJP had bagged 303 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats.Party leaders have been advised to reach out to first-time voters¬†The prime minister also emphasised the need to reach out to women, youth, farmers and the poor - whom he has often described as the four biggest ""castes"".He asked party leaders to connect a maximum number of these people with the ongoing 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra', which aims at saturation of his government's flagship welfare schemes.Senionr party leaders have also been advised focus on spreading the word about the government's positive works instead of joining issues with opposition parties in their ""negative"" campaign.The consecration ceremony at the Ram temple was one of the highlights of the two-day deliberations as the party is confident it will be a major issue in its favour in the polls.Modi's leadership, the appeal of his government's welfare schemes and the strength of its organisational machinery were cited as big reasons for the win.Different 'morchas' of the party spoke about their upcoming programmes in the run-up to the general elections.The BJP's big win in the recent assembly polls came up for praise in the meeting, with the party unit presidents of the three Hindi heartland states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh speaking on the victories.(With inputs from PTI)

"2024 election: Google to restrict queries from Bard, AI-based search","Google will restrict election-related queries from Bard and AI-based searches, Reuters reported. The announcement from the Alphabet company comes ahead of the pivotal 2024 US Presidential election. 







    While the US election garners global attention, 2024 is also crucial for other nations. India and South Africa, among others, are gearing up for national elections. Google aims to focus more on how AI could impact these elections. It indicates a shift towards more responsible AI usage in political contexts.

It earlier stopped political campaigns and advertisers in regulated industries from using its new generative AI advertising products. This move is part of a broader effort to ensure transparency and accountability in digital advertising.

X also plans to bolster its safety and elections team in anticipation of the US election.  AI regulation in politicsThese developments come as governments worldwide grapple with regulating AI. The spread of misinformation remains a key concern. The European Union (EU) is leading the charge. It has introduced rules that require Big Tech firms to label political advertising clearly.

Madhya Pradesh: Row erupts after man dressed as Lord Hanuman welcomes CM Mohan Yadav at Ujjain event,"A controversy erupted after a person dressed as Lord Hanuman welcomed newly appointed Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav at an event in Ujjain. 







    The video footage of the incident showed the person mimicking flying to welcome Yadav with a garland. 




   After the incident, the video went viral on social media.        In the footage, the person was seen hanging from a crane to welcome Yadav at the event where a huge crowd had gathered for the entry ceremony of the CM on Saturday.    The Congress party has slammed the act and questioned the need for it.    ‚ÄúIsn't the blood of hypocrites boiling by hanging Bajrang Bali on a crane and welcoming the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh with his hands? Crossed all limits,"" Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).    After his name was announced for the MP CM post, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had levelled some allegations against him on X.    ‚ÄúEight days after the election results, the BJP elected the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, a person against whom there are many serious allegations including large-scale manipulation in the Ujjain Master Plan,"" Ramesh said.    ¬†




   He also alleged that the MP government allegedly changed the land-use pattern in the Ujjain Master Plan to benefit Yadav.    On Monday, a four-day first session of the 16th Madhya Pradesh Assembly started with newly elected MLAs, including CM Mohan Yadav administering oath.    Protem Speaker Gopal Bhargava administered the oath to the MLAs and Yadav.    Addressing the media after taking oath, Yadav said, ‚ÄúToday is the first day of the 16th Assembly session. We all newly elected MLAs, including me, took the oath and kept it continuing. I am happy that on the very first day, we have given a positive message. The nomination form for the new Assembly Speaker has been submitted. I welcome this positive cooperation of the opposition and hope that they will play their positive, constructive role in the development of the state.""

Taking a jibe at CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Amethi MP said that he has sent half of his cabinet ministers to jail, now there is no guarantee how long he will stay out of prison.¬† 







    Her remark came at a public meeting held in Delhi in the presence of BJP leader Manoj Tiwari. 




   ‚ÄúI know you (BJP leader Manoj Tiwari) and the district president have no expectations from the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government. The person who has already sent half of his cabinet to jail, there is no guarantee on how long he (Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal) will stay out,"" said Irani on Sunday, according to ANI.        Senior AAP leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh are currently behind bars over money laundering allegations associated with the Delhi liquor policy case.    After AAP leader Sisodia and Singh, Delhi CM Kejriwal came under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate. The law enforcement agency had summoned the Delhi CM in November for questioning over the case.¬†    However, Kejriwal chose to not appear before the agency, calling the summons to be illegal and politically motivated. Earlier, the Delhi CM has said on many occasions that he would be arrested.¬†    ‚ÄúSimultaneous to the summons, in the afternoon of 30.10.2023, BJP leaders started making statements that soon I would be summoned and arrested.

He also claimed that BJP MP Manoj Tiwari had ‚Äúopenly"" said, on the day the summons was issued to Kejriwal -- that the chief minister would be arrested.

"AAP, Congress seal alliance for Chandigarh mayoral polls on 18 January","The AAP and the Congress have arrived at an understanding on contesting the Chandigarh mayoral polls in an alliance, sources said on Monday. 







    Under the arrangement, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will fight for the mayor's seat while the Congress will contest the posts of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, the sources said. 




   The development came amid the AAP and the Congress, both constituents of the INDIA bloc, holding talks over seat sharing for this year's Lok Sabha polls.        With the AAP and the Congress deciding to have a tie-up for the January 18 Chandigarh mayoral polls, it is going to be a two-way contest and observers believe that the two parties will have an edge over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).    In the 35-member Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the BJP has 14 councillors. The party also has an ex-officio member MP who has voting rights.    The AAP has 13 councillors and the Congress seven. The Shiromani Akali Dal has one councillor in the House.    Polls for the posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor will be held on Thursday.    The Congress abstained from voting in 2022 and 2023, leading to the BJP's victory in the mayoral polls.    Elections for the three posts are held every year during the five-year term of the House. This year, the mayor's seat has been reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) category.

'Don't need Mamata's pity': INDIA bloc faces fresh hurdle amid Congress-TMC seat sharing row in West Bengal,"Cracks within the Opposition INDIA bloc widened this week with the Congress and Trinamool Congress sparring over seat-sharing in West Bengal. The development came after reports indicated that the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC had offered the other party two Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming polls. 







    ‚ÄúIt is Mamata who needs the Congress to win, not the other way around. We are quite capable of waging a solo fight in the state and winning more seats than we did last time. We are prepared to show as much. We don't need Mamata's pity and are quite capable of retaining these two seats (even if the TMC contests them)"" said Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. 




   The party's West Bengal chief scoffed at the reported allocation, noting that the seats in question were already held by Congress representatives. The TMC won 22 seats while the Congress won two (Behrampore and Malda South) Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections.¬†        ‚ÄúWe won these seats defeating Mamata Banerjee's TMC and the BJP. Are they doing us a favour? Who will trust her (Mamata) with seat allotment?"" he asked.  ALSO READ: TMC offers 2 Lok Sabha seats to Congress in Bengal for 2024 polls: ReportChowdhury also asserted that the Trinamool Congress was ‚Äúnot serious about strengthening or forging an alliance in Bengal"".¬†    ‚ÄúThe TMC is busy pleasing and serving Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protect themselves from the clutches of the CBI and the ED. The Congress is not going to beg before TMC for seats; we don't need their alms. Who are they to decide how many seats the party will contest? If needed, we will fight on our own; let the party high command take a call on it,"" he told reporters.    (With inputs from agencies)

‚ÄòLalan Singh wanted to change Bihar CM‚Ä¶‚Äô: BJP's big allegations against outgoing JD(U) chief,"A leadership change in Bihar's ruling Janata Dal United JD(U) raised the political heat in the state with BJP finding fresh ammunition to attack Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led Mahagathbandha alliance. Former Deputy CM of Bihar and BJP MP Sushil Modi alleged that JD(U) President Rajeev Ranjan Singh aka Lalan Singh was removed from his position as he was engineering defections in JD(U) with a plan to install Tejashwi Yadav as the next chief minister of Bihar. 







    The remarks come as Lalan Singh stepped down from his positions on Friday and Nitish Kumar took the reins of JD(U) at the national executive meeting of the party in New Delhi. 




   ‚ÄúWe had already announced earlier that Lalan Singh would be removed since he broke 12-13 MLAs off the JD(U) party and he had prepared to make Tejashwi Yadav CM by joining hands with Lalu Yadav but Nitish Kumar got to know it so he pre-empted it and removed Lalan Singh timely,"" Sushil Modi said.        The BJP MP also added that the removal of Lalan Singh is just the ‚Äúbeginning of the game."" ‚ÄúA lot of it is left,"" he remarked.    Sushil Modi said Nitish Kumar already had all the authority in the party and his recent move seems to be in the hope of a better position in the INDIA alliance. ‚ÄúNitish Kumar has a misunderstanding that the INDIA alliance will make him the convenor or party's face for PM...Our gates are closed for him,"" he added.  Parties should show big heart to make INDIA alliance successfulJD(U) chief spokesperson K C Tyagi affirmed that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar took charge of the party because of his wide acceptability among the people. The resolution adopted at the JD(U) meeting spoke in length about Nitish Kumar's leadership credentials and his ability to take everyone along.    ""The JD(U) believes that bigger parties in the alliance have more responsibilities... They will have to show a big heart to make this grand alliance successful. They will have to be generous if any leader has to be given the responsibility as per experience and capabilities,"" it said.    ¬†

  Article 370 verdict LIVE updates""Today, the decision (by Supreme Court on Article 370) has also come. Still, they (Congress) say that they don't accept this and that Article 370 was abrogated wrongfully. I can't explain to them what is the reality...Article 370 boosted separatism and separatism led to the rise of terrorism. One wrong decision can be taken but when history and time prove that the decision is wrong, one should come back towards the interest of the nation. I still say, come back otherwise there won't remain even how many are left now (MPs elected to the House). If you want to stick to this decision even today, public is watching - there will be face off in 2024 and PM Modi will become the PM for the third time,"" Union Amit Shah said while discussions in Rajya Sabha.

So a provision was inserted inside Article 373 that the President can amend Section 370, ban it and can also take it completely out of the Constitution..."" the minister added while speaking in Rajya Sabha.¬†    While speaking on the two bills related to Jammu and Kashmir, Amit Shah said that the Union Government has reserved 24 seats in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as the region is ours. ""...Earlier there were 37 seats in Jammu, now after the new delimitation commission, there are 43 seats. Earlier there were 46 in Kashmir, now there are 47 and in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, 24 seats have been reserved since we PoK is ours..."" the Union Home Minister said.  Bills on Jammu and KashmirThe Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 aims to amend the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019. The 2019 Act had previously made alterations to the Second Schedule of the 1950 Act, specifically outlining that the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly would consist of 83 seats. The current proposed Bill aims to augment the total number of seats to 90. Additionally, it introduces a provision for reserving seven seats for Scheduled Castes and nine seats for Scheduled Tribes. Furthermore, the Bill stipulates that the Lieutenant Governor is empowered to nominate up to two members from the Kashmiri migrant community to serve in the Legislative Assembly.  Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 offers preferential treatment in employment opportunities and enrollment in professional educational institutions for individuals belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other socio-educationally disadvantaged groups. The proposed Bill replaces the term ""weak and underprivileged classes"" with ""other backward classes"" as officially identified by the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.    Both the bills were passed unanimously in the Rajya Sabha as the Opposition parties staged a walk-out during the discussions.¬†    ¬†

"Sanjay Raut invokes Uddhav Thackeray‚Äôs name for INDIA bloc‚Äôs PM candidate, says he is a ‚Äònationalist face‚Äô","Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday, December 6 invoked the name of Uddhav Thackeray for the INDIA alliance‚Äôs prime ministerial candidate for the 2024 general elections, saying that Thackeray is a ‚Äúnationalist face"". 







    Replying to a reporter‚Äôs query about the PM face for the 2024¬† Lok Sabha elections, Raut said: ‚ÄúThere will be a discussion on this. There should indeed be a face."" 




   However, he refrained from directly putting Uddhav‚Äôs name in the race.        ‚ÄúUddhav Thackeray is a Hindutvawadi, nationalist face. A person who gets the approval of the INDIA alliance members can be the (PM) face. I don't want to say anything outside which might create any rift in the alliance,"" he added.    A meeting of the members of the INDIA alliance was scheduled to be held on Wednesday, but it was postponed as many constituents refused to attend the meeting, which was called by the Congress party.    The meeting had been postponed and could be organized on December 16 and 18, said Raut.    ‚ÄúThe INDIA alliance meeting was supposed to be held today but some prominent leaders were not available. There is a wedding in Mamata Banerjee's house, MK Stalin is busy with the relief operation in his flood-hit state, Nitish Kumar is not well, and Akhilesh Yadav is not available, therefore this meeting will be held on December 16 or 18. The face etc. everything will be decided in the meeting. We are together and you will see its result in 2024,"" he added.¬†    Many INDIA bloc allies, including TMC, National Conference, Samajwadi Party, JDU and RJD have blamed the Congress for its defeat in the recent assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.¬†    On Tuesday, Raut said that Shiv Sena UBT, Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress will contest the Lok Sabha election together.    ‚ÄúWe, the Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress are going to contest the election together (in Maharashtra). The BJP's strength has not increased. They want to make themselves capable by breaking down others. But people of Maharashtra think differently than people in other states,"" said Raut.

BJP winning elections in Gaumutra states: DMK MP's comments spark row; BJP says ‚Äòtake mental treatment‚Äô,"After the BJP's landslide victory in India's heartland states, several leaders have been calling out how the party's popularity is limited only to north India.

Congress's Bharat Jodo Yatra 2.0 in December? Sources say possibility can't be ruled out,"The possibility of the second phase of the Bharat Jodo Yatra in December cannot be ruled out, sources in the Congress told news agency ANI on Tuesday. The statement came amid reports hinting at the relaunch of the Bharat Jodo Yatra between December and February. 







    In September 2023, some of the Congress working committee (CWC) members had reportedly urged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to undertake another Bharat Jodo Yatra, this time from the east to west. The first one was from Kanyakumari (south) to Kashmir (north). 




   The Hindustan Times had reported that the second phase of the Bharat Jodo Yatra is expected to start from Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh and end at Porbandar in Gujarat, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.        ""Unlike the first march, this one may not be entirely on foot. Gandhi might use vehicles or boats to cover certain areas in the second phase,"" the report quoted the Congress saying in the past.    Several reports also suggested that the Bharat Jodo Yatra 2.0 might be in the hybrid mode. An India Today report said that this time, participants may be seen marching on foot as well as using vehicles.    The Congress's first Bharat Jodo Yatra became India‚Äôs longest foot march after it covered 75 districts in 126 days. The yatra had started from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu on September 7 last year. It covered a total distance of 4,080 km before ending in Srinagar in Kashmir on January 30.    Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had led the first phase of the yatra and the primary objective of this mass movement was to unite India against the Centre-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's divisive politics.    The report quoted a Congress leader as saying that the party made electoral gains in some states such as Karnataka after the first Bharat Jodo Yatra.. ‚ÄúIf the yatra takes place in January, it would be right before the Lok Sabha polls,"" the working committee member had said.

   Sukhpal Khaira is an MLA from Bholath in Kapurthala of Punjab and Chairman of All India Kisan Congress.    Leader of the Congress party in the Punjab assembly and senior leader Partap Singh Bajwa questioned the detention of Khaira saying that the AAP government in Punjab had resorted to low level vendetta politics.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/congress-mla-sukhpal-singh-khaira-detained-by-punjab-police-in-connection-with-old-drug-case-11695878150766.html
'BJP can't set foot here': AIADMK and BJP snapping ties in Tamil Nadu explained,"AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami had met Union Home Minister and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah in New Delhi, a few days ago, triggering speculations that the saffron party and the Dravidian party are considering a coalition for Tamil Nadu. However, on Monday, senior AIADMK leader D Jayaram announced that they are snapping ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party.¬† 







    This brought an end to an unending bickering between the AIADMK and the BJP that ensued in the previous few days. On Monday, D Jayaram said that AIADMK cannot tolerate any affront to the late Chief Minister Dravidian stalwart CN Annadurai, ¬†fondly addressed as Anna (elder brother), EV Ramasamy Periyar and late AIADMK veterans MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa. 




   Notably, the AIADMK and BJP relationship had come into question during the Sanatan Dharma remark row that began with DMK leader and Tamil Nadu Chief minister's son Udhayanidhi Stalin's remark.¬†      Annamalai's remarks on AIADMK leadersThe rift began with Tamil Nadu BJP leader Annamalai's comments on former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, and Annadurai.¬†  Comments on Jayalalithaa:¬†During an interview K Annamalai said had previously said, ‚Äúmany administrations of Tamil Nadu were corrupt with former chief ministers convicted in courts of law."" The former BJP allies in Tamil Nadu, and their saffron party's Dravidian connect for a bastion in the south had passed a condemnation resolution against Annamalai for his remark.¬†  Comments on Annadurai:Further on September 11, leading a demonstration against Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister P K Sekar Babu for his participation in the 'Sanatana Dharma' eradication conference here, Annamalai had made a comment on Annadurai.    Speaking to reporters in Coimbatore on Sunday, Annamalai asked if what he had said about Anna was wrong. He asserted that he is in politics to protect Sanatan Dharma and Tamil culture.    He insisted that he did not speak ill of Anna and had only mentioned an event from the pages of history and the manner in which Muthuramalinga Thevar had defended Sanatana Dharma.    To substantiate his claim, the BJP leader said, he had copies of news reports that appeared in the month of June in 1956 in a top national English daily.    The BJP leader said Anna had in the 1950s made a critical remark in Madurai against the Hindu faith at an event, and that it was staunchly opposed by freedom fighter Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar.  BJP's ambition of Tamil Nadu seatsWhile BJP leader Annamalai's remarks gave birth to seething tension between AIADMK and BJP, adding to an already strained relationship, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had told BJP workers in Tamil Nadu to target over 25 seats in the next general elections.  Why did AIADMK cut ties with BJP?¬†Senior AIADMK leader D Jayakumar, lashing out at Annamalai for his criticism of Annadurai, said his party workers will not tolerate any insult to the late CM.    While Annamalai had made critical remarks about AIADMK leaders including the late J Jayalalithaa in the past, the party had sought that the former be restrained.    ""Annamalai doesn't desire an alliance with AIADMK although BJP workers want it. Should we tolerate all this criticism of our leaders? Why should we carry you? BJP can't set foot here. Your votebank is known. You are known because of us,"" the former minister told reporters here while lashing out at the BJP and its state unit president.    ""We can't tolerate anymore (the criticism of leaders). As far as the alliance is concerned, it is not there. BJP is not with AIADMK. (the matter) can be decided only during the election. This is our stand,"" he said.    ""Our party has his (Annadurai) name. To promote himself, he belittles Periyar. He didn't budge even after condemnation. It is against coalition dharma; no AIADMK worker will accept this. Annamalai is unfit to be a leader and he is keen only about promoting him. What right have you got to talk about Periyar, EPS (Palaniswami), Amma (Jayalalithaa) and MGR. AIADMK workers will never accept this,"" Jayakumar added.    The AIADMK had nothing to lose over the alliance-related development. ""They are the losers,"" he said about the BJP. He repeatedly claimed the BJP and Annamalai will fare badly electorally without the AIADMK.  Will this affect the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections?¬†Trouble in paradise arises, when the saffron party, perprtartors and practitioners of Sanatan Dharma tries their luck in the Dravidian state. The issue of an alleged ‚ÄòHindi Imposition‚Äô also lessens chances of BJP establishing control in Tamil nadu. Loosing their Dravidian alliance with loosely thoguht comments can potentially prove fatal for the saffron party in the southern state.¬†    ¬†

PM Modi can't be defeated by ‚Äòsheep and goats‚Äô: CM Shinde takes a sharp jibe at the opposition,"Taking a sharp jibe at the opposition parties, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said ""sheep and goats"" cannot put up a fight against a lion in a jungle.¬† 







    ¬†CM Shinde told a Hindi channel, ‚ÄúThe opposition only thinks about defeating Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I do not see anywhere the opposition is putting up a fight."" 




   ‚ÄúI will not call opposition vultures but sheep and goats cannot come together to put up a fight against a lion in a jungle. A lion is always a lion and he would rule the jungle.""

"Rahul Gandhi questions Telangana CM's proximity with BJP, asks ‚Äòwhy no ED, CBI, I-T cases against him‚Äô","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday attacked Telangana Chief Minister and Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) supremo K. Chandrashekar Rao and questioned his proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP. Rahul Gandhi asked why there is no case against Telangana CM when ED, CBI, and Income Tax Department are after all the opposition leaders. 







    ""There is some case against every opposition leader. ED, CBI, and Income Tax Department are after all the opposition leaders but there is no case against Telangana CM, or there is no case against AIMIM leaders... PM Narendra Modi never attacks his own people, he considers your CM and AIMIM party as his own, hence there is no case against him. He has broken all records of corruption but there is no case against him,"" Rahul Gandhi said addressing a rally in Telangana. 




   Intensifying his jibe against K. Chandrashekar Rao, Rahul Gandhi said ""We call BRS party as 'BJP Rishtedaar Samithi.""        While talking about how the Congress-led UPA fulfilled the promise of the creation of Telangana, Rahul Gandhi emphasized that Sonia Gandhi delivers whatever she promises.    ""I saw Sonia (Gandhi) ji's speech. Whatever Sonia ji says she fulfils it. She does not speak loudly but when she says something, she does it,"" Rahul Gandhi said and recalled how the Congress fulfilled the promise of creation of Telangana. ""We did not give statehood to Telangana for the benefit of KCR and his family,"" he said.  Six guarantees of CongressRahul Gandhi spoke about the six guarantees Congress has promised for Telangana if it is voted to power. The first guarantee is about providing  ‚Çπ5 lakh for the construction of houses for all those who don't have one. The second is the Mahalakshmi scheme in which  ‚Çπ2,500 will be given to women, a cylinder for Rs. 500, and free travel in buses.    The third guarantee is Griha Jyoti which promises 200 units of free electricity for every family. Under the fourth scheme,  ‚Çπ5 lakh will be given as financial assistance in college and coaching education. Rahul Gandhi said the 5th guarantee is  ‚Çπ4,000 monthly pension for elderly and  ‚Çπ10 lakh health insurance. The sixth guarantee is  ‚Çπ15,000 for farmers and  ‚Çπ12,000 for farm labourers annually.  (With inputs PTI)    ¬†

"‚ÄòBecome a Sanatani,‚Äô Congress leader's  suggestion to PM Modi on his birthday","On PM Narendra Modi's 73rd birthday, Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal giving him a suggestion said ‚ÄòBecome a Sanatani‚Äô. He further claimed the BJP doesn't know the true meaning of 'Sanatan'. 







    ¬† 








       Further on the Santan Dharma' row, Sibal said, ‚ÄúAre they (BJP) the votaries or protectors of 'Sanatana Dharma'? The virtues of 'Sanatana Dharama' are honesty, no injury to living beings, purity, charity, patience... Do they have even one of these qualities? Can they ever be 'Sanatanis'? Can they ever protect 'Sanatana Dharma' when their whole activities are unrelated to the virtues of a 'Sanatani'?...""    He further goes o to add, ‚ÄúIs it 'Sanatani' to protect somebody who is alleged to have molested women wrestlers? Is it 'Sanatani' to keep quiet when what was happening in Manipur? Can you become a Ram Bhakt by building a Ram temple?""    ‚ÄúBuilding a Ram temple is politics becoming a Ram Bhakt is purity...I challenge them, please tell the people of this country what one quality of a 'Sanatani' you have?"" he said.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/become-a-sanatani-congress-leader-suggestion-to-pm-modi-on-his-birthday-11694928744792.html
INDIA has hidden agenda to end Sanatana Dharma: PM Modi on Udhayanidhi Stalin's remark,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday elaborately spoke about the controversy surrounding the Sanatana Dharma remark made by Tamil Nadu minister Udhayanidhi Stalin. Addressing a massive gathering at Bina in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, PM Modi said that the INDIA alliance has a ‚Äúhidden agenda"" to attack and end the Sanatana Dharma culture. 







    Unleashing a no holds barred attack on the Opposition bloc ‚Äî the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) ‚Äî PM Narendra Modi called it an ‚ÄúINDI alliance"" that ‚Äúdoes not have a leader"". 




   ‚ÄúAt a time when Bharat is emerging as a world leader at global forums, some parties are trying to divide the country and its people. These people came together to form an ‚ÄòINDI‚Äô alliance. Some people are calling it a ‚Äòghamndiya (arrogant) alliance‚Äô. They don‚Äôt have a leader yet and there is a lot of suspense on who would lead them going into the Lok Sabha elections next year. They are working with a hidden agenda, which is to¬†attack India's culture,"" PM Modi said.        PM Modi also alleged that in its third meeting, the Opposition bloc adopted a resolution to ‚Äúend the Sanatana culture"" in the country.    The prime minister said, ‚ÄúThis INDI-Alliance adopted a resolution to end our 'Sanatana' culture. They are bent on destroying the ideologies, cultures and traditions that have kept the country and our people together for centuries.""    PM Modi's attack on the Opposition came a few days after CM MK Stalin's son, Udhayanidhi Stalin, said that Sanatana Dharma is incompatible with the concept of social justice and should be ‚Äúeliminated."" ‚ÄúSanatana is like malaria and dengue and so it must be eradicated and not opposed,"" Udhayanidhi Stalin said.    PM Modi addressed the meeting after¬†laying the foundation for several projects worth more than  ‚Çπ50,700 crores, including the 'Petrochemical Complex' at Bina Refinery and ten new industrial projects across Madhya Pradesh.    The 10 projects for which he laid the foundation stone include a¬†‚ÄòPower and Renewable Energy Manufacturing Zone‚Äô in the Narmadapuram district; two IT parks in Indore; a Mega Industrial Park in Ratlam; and six new industrial areas across the state.

‚ÄòPrime Minister of Bharat‚Äô: Sambit Patra shares invitation of PM Modi's Indonesia visit amid India's name change rumour,"BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Tuesday shared official information regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Indonesia for the 20th ASEAN-India and the 18th East Asia summits in which he has been referred to as the ‚ÄòPrime Minister of Bharat‚Äô. 







    The reference to PM Modi Modi as the ""Prime Minister of Bharat"" comes close on the heels of a G20 invite for a Presidential dinner on September 9 in the name of the ‚ÄúPresident of Bharat"".¬† 




   This triggered a row as opposition parties alleged that the central government is planning to drop India and stay with just Bharat as the country's name. Customarily, in English, the country is referred to as India.    




   Senior BJP leaders and ministers have cheered the move by the Rashtrapati Bhavan with Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar asking what is the problem with using ""President of Bharat"" as the country is also Bharat.    It also fuelled the speculation that the issue of changing the name of the country could come up during the five-day special session of Parliament beginning September 18.¬†    Opposition leaders, including Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, who first highlighted the development, accused the government of assaulting the idea of the country being a ""Union of States"", as mentioned in the Constitution which describes the country as ""India, that is Bharat"".    Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""So the news is indeed true. Rashtrapati Bhawan has sent out an invite for a G20 dinner on 9 September in the name of ‚ÄòPresident of Bharat‚Äô instead of the usual ‚ÄòPresident of India‚Äô.""Now, Article 1 in the Constitution can read: Bharat, that was India, shall be a Union of States.""    The row came four days after Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat made a strong pitch for using Bharat instead of India.    Addressing an event in Guwahati on 1 September, Bhagwat said the country‚Äôs name as Bharat has continued since ancient times and must be taken forward.¬†    ‚ÄúThe name of our country has been Bharat for ages. Whatever may be the language, the name remains the same,"" the RSS chief said.    ¬†  (With PTI inputs)

No rakhi for Rahul Gandhi? Congress issues clarification as BJP scrutinises Wayanad MP's wrist,"The Congress found itself locked into an unlikely debate with the BJP on Sunday over Rahul Gandhi's wrist. Debate about the Wayanad MP's current relationship sister Priyanka Gandhi raged on social media with both parties sharing conflicting videos to back their assertion. The BJP insisted that the siblings had fallen out - citing the lack of a rakhi on Gandhi's hand - and laid forward several reasons for the same. As the clip went viral, the Congress stepped forward with a video of their own ‚Äì where Gandhi did indeed have a rakhi tied to his wrist. 







    ‚ÄúDo talk about the issues sometime - now being frustrated Rahul ji did not tie Rakhi, you are spreading lies. This anger is natural because of the war waged by both the brothers and sisters against your market of lies and hatred. Hey guys, get both your eyes and brain treated, Rahul ji not only tied a rakhi, but he keeps tying that rakhi throughout the year,"" tweeted party leader Supriya Shrinate in Hindi. 




   The BJP claimed that Priyanka Gandhi had hatched a 'conspiracy' after being 'sidelined' for years. To this end, she had advised Rahul Gandhi to not apologise amid the Modi surname row.    




   Gandhi had been attending the launch of Gruha Lakshmi Yojana in Karnataka as the country celebrated Raksha bandhan on August 30. He had then headed to Mumbai for the third meeting of Opposition bloc INDIA the next day. The speculative assertions began during this time with BJP leaders claiming there was a ‚Äútussle"" underway between Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.    ‚ÄúMy brother and I have and will always have only love, trust, respect and loyalty towards each other. Do not worry, we both brother-sister, along with millions of sisters and brothers of the country, will break the arrogance of your lies, loot and hollow propaganda together. Happy Raksha Bandhan. It is a festival of love between brother and sister, celebrate it with a positive spirit,"" the Congress general secretary tweeted in response to a post by BJP IT department head Amit Malviya.¬†    Other Opposition leaders including Shiv Sena (UBT) lawmaker Priyanka Chaturvedi have also lashed out at the BJP.¬†    ‚ÄúThe language and the content of this video tweeted by BJP handle, clearly suggests that the script written by Silly Souls Production and produced by Foolish Trolls Company. Must pity the new levels BJP can plumb to for their desperation to be in power,"" she tweeted.    (With inputs from agencies)

Congress says will gift Smriti Irani gas cylinder she carried in 2013-14,"Congress party‚Äôs national youth president Srinivas BV on Monday said that they have found the old cooking gas cylinder that Union minister Smriti Irani used to carry in 2013-14, which they bought it for  ‚Çπ21,000 and it will be gifted back to her. 







    ‚ÄúIrani is making a lot of statements these days, I want to tell her that the old gas cylinder she used to carry in 2013-2014, we found out that cylinder and bought it for  ‚Çπ21,000. We will gift it to her,"" Srinivas said. 




   He made the comment while talking to media persons in Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs Indore district on Monday.        ‚ÄúThey (BJP) forgot what they used to say about the then Manmohan Singh government, he was making them recall. They had said inflation was made dayan (witch). The BJP leaders are doing the work of making the same inflation sit in the bedroom by making it a darling. Why?"" said the Congress leader.    The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was wasting its time in Madhya Pradesh and they were going to wash out from here in the upcoming assembly polls, Srinivas claimed.    The assembly elections in the state are slated to be held later this year.    ‚ÄúBJP is wasting its time in MP. They are going to get clear from here. In this 50 per cent commission government, 35 per cent commission is being transferred to Delhi and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh is getting the remaining 15 per cent,"" the Congress youth leader alleged.    When asked BJP is claiming Rahul Gandhi will never become the prime minister, Srinivas said that Rahul Gandhi would become prime minister in 2024.    On BJP‚Äôs remarks over Rahul Gandhi spreading kerosene, Srinivas¬† said that they (BJP) say anything in the name of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi to please PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.

'PM Modi's charisma would benefit Maharashtra': Ajit Pawar amid speculations of joining Sharad Pawar,"Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday said he was hopeful that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's charisma will benefit the state which follows secular thoughts. The remarks came while addressing a rally in the Beed district, according to a report published by the news agency PTI.¬† 







    The NCP leader said that nobody is a permanent friend or foe in politics, while also thanking local leaders of Shiv Sena and BJP for welcoming him along with other party leaders in the Maharashtra government.¬† 




   In the rally, Ajit Pawar said, ‚ÄúNobody is permanent friend or foe in politics. This is politics. It is our expectation that PM Modi's charisma would benefit Maharashtra and hence we all decided to join the (BJP-Shiv Sena) government for the benefit of the state.""        He further clarified that there is ‚Äòno self-interest‚Äô behind joining the Maharashtra government and dismissed any kind of speculative talks in this matter, as per PTI reports.¬†    ‚ÄúI am a person who likes to work and like to speak through my work. I won't respond to comments made against me by anyone,"" Ajit Pawar said.¬†    Notably, Ajit Pawar's uncle and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had addressed a rally in Beed ten days ago.¬†    In July, Ajit Pawar and eight other NCP MLAs joined the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra. He was then sworn in as a Deputy Chief Minister of the state along with BJP‚Äôs Devendra Fadnavis.    However, there are speculation that Ajit Pawar might be willing to join Sharad Pawar's party again. With the Ajit Pawar group still using Sharad Pawar‚Äôs picture on some of its billboards, it is clear that the faction is not confident of winning elections without the support of Sharad Pawar.    The Pawar senior has consistently maintained that he is against joining hands with the BJP and has called Ajit Pawar and other MLAs ‚Äúcowards"" without taking their names.    On Friday, Sharad Pawar claimed that there was no split on NCP and Ajit Pawar is its leader, however, he denied his statement within hours, PTI reported.¬†    He had also said that the opportunity to correct oneself is given once but the opportunity cannot be given again or one shouldn't ask for it again, apparently referring to Ajit Pawar's early-morning oath ceremony with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis after the 2019 assembly polls.    ¬†  (With PTI inputs)

RSS Defamation Case: Rahul Gandhi moves Bombay HC against Thane court order,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has moved the Bombay High Court challenging the Thane court order in the RSS defamation case. The court had earlier taken the transcript of the alleged defamatory speech as evidence in the pending criminal defamation case filed by an RSS worker Rajesh Kunte.¬† 







    Rahul Gandhi claimed that the Magistrate's order was in violation of an order of a single judge of the High Court in another petition filed by Kunte which was related to the same defamation complaint, according to a report published by Bar and Bench.¬† 




   Bhiwandi-based RSS activist Rajesh Kunte had filed a defamation suit against the Gandhi scion for holding the organization responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.¬†        Kunte‚Äôs suit claims that Gandhi, in an election speech on 6 March 2014, in Bhiwandi said that ‚ÄúRSS people killed Mahatma Gandhi"".¬†    The Congress leader appeared in court for the first time in this case on 8 July 2015. He challenged the case in the Supreme Court on 8 September 2016, but later withdrew his petition saying he would fight the case in the Bhiwandi court.    Earlier in March this year, Rahul Gandhi faced a fresh defamation case. A complaint was filed with a Haridwar court in connection with remarks made by the former MP during the Bharat Jodo Yatra. Gandhi had described the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) as ‚Äú21st century Kauravas"" during an address in January.    The issue - one in a series of flashpoints between the Congress party and the ruling BJP - has however served to united numerous opposition parties. Many of them accuse the Centre of diverting attention from the Adani-Hindenburg issue.

"Congress' Jairam Ramesh brands PM Modi as 'tsunami of lies', shares article labeling him as 'fascist","In a fresh attack on PM Modi over his Parliament speech during the recently-concluded monsoon session, Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said that the Prime Minister always speaks a tsunami of lies. 







    The Congress leader also share an excerpt from an article that he claimed was written by Ashis Nandy, one of India's leading scholars trained as a clinical psychologist. In the article, Nandy called Modi a ‚Äúclassic, and clinical case of a fascist"". 




   In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Jairam Ramesh said, ‚ÄúEverytime the PM speaks it is a torrent of abuse, a tsunami of lies. His recent speech in Parliament made me recall what Ashis Nandy, one of India's leading scholars trained as a clinical psychologist, wrote in early 2002 in the Seminar magazine. This is the crucial excerpt.""    




   ‚ÄúMore than a decade ago, when Narendra Modi was a nobody, a small-time RSS pracharak trying to make it as a small-time BJP functionary, I had the privilege of interviewing him along with Achyut Yagnik, whom Modi could not fortunately recognize. It was a long, rambling interview, but it left me in no doubt that here was a classic, clinical case of a fascist. I never use the term ‚Äòfascist‚Äô as a term of abuse; to me, it is a diagnostic category comprising not only one‚Äôs ideological posture but also the personality traits and motivational patterns contextualizing the ideology,"" the article read.¬†    The Congress leader's remarks came after PM Modi slammed the Opposition bloc Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) and called it a ""ghamandiya"" (arrogant) alliance.¬†    He also recounted the dramatic events in Parliament, claiming that the Opposition abandoned their own motion midway, unable to face the prospect of a vote.    ""The truth is that the opposition got scared of voting on a no-confidence motion. Had there been voting, the 'ghamandiya' alliance would have been exposed,"" ANI quoted PM Modi as saying.    The no-confidence motion, spearheaded by the opposition, was tabled on July 26. Throughout the ensuing three-day debate, tensions flared between the ruling and Opposition factions, particularly around issues like the Manipur violence.

Rahul Gandhi's ‚Äòflying kiss‚Äô was a gesture of love and affection: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi,"As a controversy erupted over Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's alleged ‚Äòflying kiss‚Äô gesture, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi termed the gesture ‚Äúaffectionate"". 







    ""I don't understand that when he was speaking, all the ministers were standing up. Ministers were creating obstructions. He made an affectionate gesture, what problem do you have with it? You are habitual of so much hatred that you fail to understand any gesture of love, of affection,"" Chaturvedi said as quoted by ANI. 




   She further said that Rahul Gandhi's words were not driven by animosity, despite his disqualification and subsequent legal victory.        ‚ÄúYou disqualified Rahul Gandhi as an MP and ousted him from his residence. He came back after winning his cases. Still, he is not talking to you out of hatred. If you have a problem, it is your problem and nobody else's,"" the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader said.  Only a misogynistic man who can give a flying kiss to a Parliament: Smriti IraniOn Wednesday, Union Minister Smriti Irani, along with several BJP MPs, voiced their strong objections following an alleged flying kiss gesture made by Gandhi towards BJP MPs in the Lok Sabha. However, the incident was not caught on camera    ‚ÄúThe one who was given the chance to speak before me, displayed indecency before leaving. It is only a misogynistic man who can give a flying kiss to a Parliament which seats female members of Parliament. Such undignified conduct has never before seen in the Parliament of the country...,"" Irani said.    Demanding strict action against Rahul Gandhi, National Democratic Alliance (NDA) women MPs wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker OM Birla alleging the Congress MP of making inappropriate gesture and displaying indecent behaviour in the House.    In a complaint, signed by more than 20 women parliamentarians, it was alleged that the Congress member made an ""inappropriate gesture"" towards Irani when was speaking in the House.¬†  (With inputs from agencies)

'A victory for justice'! Congress celebrates as Lok Sabha restores 'Wayanad MP' Rahul Gandhi's membership | WATCH,"Congress party on Monday was in a mood of celebration after the Lok Sabha secretariat restored the membership of party leader Rahul Gandhi. Gandhi's membership as MP from Kerala's Wayanad constituency got restored during the Monsoon Session of the Parliament on Monday. 







    The Lok Sabha Secretariat on Monday issued a notification announcing that his disqualification has been revoked. 




 Gandhi was disqualified from the lower house in March 2023 after a Gujarat court convicted him in a defamation case and sentenced him to two years in jail.        A punishment of two years and above automatically disqualifies a lawmaker.    On Friday, the Supreme Court stayed his conviction in the criminal defamation case of the use of the 'Modi' surname.    The Congress leader had challenged the trial court order at the Gujarat High Court, which upheld the ruling of the lower court.    However, the SC observed that no reason was given by the trial court judge while convicting him except that he was admonished by the apex court in a contempt case.    Former Gujarat minister Purnesh Modi had filed a criminal defamation case in 2019 against Gandhi over his ""How come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?"" remark made during an election rally in Kolar, Karnataka, on April 13, 2019.    Hailing the decision by the Lok Sabha secretariat, following the apex court's order, senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ""With enormous relief, welcome the official announcement of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs reinstatement. He can now resume his duties in the Lok Sabha to serve the people of India and his constituents in Wayanad. A victory for justice and for our democracy!"".




   Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury put a piece of sweet inside Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge's mouth. Other INDIA alliances also celebrated the restoration of Lok Sabha membership of Rahul Gandhi today.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/rahul-gandhi-congress-celebrates-as-lok-sabha-restores-wayanad-mp-membership-11691384375019.html
"PM Modi is very similar to Indira, Rajiv Gandhi as‚Ä¶, says Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar","Drawing a parallel between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, late Rajiv Gandhi and late Indira Gandhi, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said on Tuesday expressed that these great leaders share some similar traits.¬† 







    ""There is no other personality in the country who has popularity like Modi ji. Look at the work he has done‚Ä¶, the kind of respect India gets at the global level,"" the deputy CM said while speaking to PTI. 




   ""Indira Gandhi used to get similar kind of respect (when she visited other countries)....Rajiv Gandhi had an image of Mr Clean. Similarly, we are seeing (that) in the form of Modi,"" he said.        Pawar was speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Pune where PM Modi received the Lokmanya Tilak National Award.  ‚ÄòNobody supported whatever that is happening in Manipur‚ÄôSpeaking on the Manipur violence and oppositions demand that PM should speak at the Parliament, he said, ""Any prime minister will think of having a good atmosphere in the country from the law and order point of view. Nobody supported whatever that is happening in Manipur. The prime minister has taken cognizance of the issue. Chief Justice of India has also taken cognizance. Everyone has condemned whatever happened there. ""    The Centre and the Manipur government are ensuring the culprits of May 3 incident (where two women were paraded naked) are punished, he said.  ‚ÄòThere is no other leader with popularity like PM Modi at the international level‚ÄôPraising PM for working long hours tirelessly, Pawar said. ""During Diwali, while rest of the country celebrates Diwali at home, he celebrates it with army soldiers on the borders,"" he said.    ""We have been seeing his work for the last nine years. There is no other leader with popularity like Modi at the international level. The truth is the truth. I want development. Being in an opposition party, we can stage protests and take out morchas, but the decision lies with those who are in power,"" Pawar said.

"BJP leaders claim success in stifling Rahul Yatra in Assam, ensuring it did not gain momentum in NE","ASSAM CHIEF Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma‚Äôs constant attacks on Rahul Gandhi during the Congress leader‚Äôs Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra through the state carried the whiff of the bitterness in which their ties had ended. However, sources close to Sarma say, the CM‚Äôs offensive was also strategic, as it kept Rahul caught up in trying to firefight the Assam situation.
Rahul entered Assam shortly after launching the second leg of his Bharat Jodo Yatra from Manipur, a state where a nine-month-long internal conflict has put the BJP government on the back foot. There was some apprehension in BJP circles that Rahul would carry the momentum of the Manipur kick-off into Assam, and generate a good response, especially among the Muslim community in Assam, that makes up more than 35% of the state‚Äôs population.
Instead, Rahul‚Äôs Yatra found itself caught up in scuffles with security forces, over permissions of various sorts. On the day of the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration, for example, with all eyes on what Rahul would do ‚Äì after top Congress leaders had pulled out of the event ‚Äì he was not allowed to visit a revered Assam shrine. While he did a sit-in to mark his protest, Rahul eventually had to give up, and concede to the Assam government.

Assam BJP sources say Sarma also ensured that Rahul was distracted from his main Yatra theme of attacking the Modi government. An offensive against the Prime Minister would have got Rahul eyeballs among the opponents of the BJP, which in turn would have given the Congress leader a boost ahead of his Yatra‚Äôs entry into West Bengal and Bihar, where it is covering or will cover minority-dominated areas.
BJP leaders, in fact, claim that the way Rahul‚Äôs Yatra had progressed in Assam had spurred on Trinamool Congress Mamata Banerjee to flex muscles and declare the INDIA alliance all but over in West Bengal, just two days ahead of the march‚Äôs entry into her state.
An enthusiastic response in Assam might have made her reluctant to do so, a BJP leader claimed. Her move, in turn, triggered a dynamo reaction among other INDIA partners.

A senior BJP leader based in Delhi said: ‚ÄúThe Assam CM‚Äôs constant attacks on the Congress leader meant many in the public were reluctant to be seen around his Yatra.‚ÄùAdvertisement
Officially though, the BJP maintained that Sarma was guided purely by law and order considerations, a claim repeated by a party leader from Assam.
The Congress countered the BJP‚Äôs claims regarding the Yatra, with party Assam MP Gaurav Gogoi, who played a key role in it, insisting that it had been ‚Äúa huge success‚Äù in the state.
‚ÄúThe Assam chapter of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra touched upon the most important issue on people‚Äôs minds, which is the rampant corruption associated with the CM and his immediate family. The tag of ‚Äòthe most corrupt CM‚Äô rattled Sarma, and his attempts to block the Yatra escalated after that comment,‚Äù Gogoi told The Indian Express.Advertisement
He also claimed that the state government not letting Rahul visit the Batadrava Than shrine on January 22 ‚Äúboomeranged‚Äù on the BJP and earned tremendous goodwill for the Yatra. ‚ÄúSubsequently, in Guwahati on January 23, we witnessed a huge crowd for the Congress despite no local MLAs of the party in the city,‚Äù Gogoi said, lauding Rahul for raising issues central to the situation in the Northeast, including the conflict in Manipur, the unresolved Naga political issue, and Sarma‚Äôs ‚Äúobscene‚Äù corruption.
‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to build on the momentum generated by the Yatra and prepare the ground for the Lok Sabha elections,‚Äù Gogoi said.
As per BJP sources, the party‚Äôs public posturing notwithstanding, it had been taken aback by the response to Rahul‚Äôs first Yatra (September 2022-January 2023), including through party-ruled states (which was seen as reflecting poorly on BJP state units) ‚Äì despite the Yatra‚Äôs political gains remaining limited.
This time, the BJP was particularly conscious about not letting Rahul cash in on the resentment in many parts of the Northeast due to the Manipur situation. Sources point to Union Home Minister Amit Shah‚Äôs three-day visit to Meghalaya and Assam beginning January 18 to address the plenary session of the North Eastern Council, four days after Rahul‚Äôs Yatra started.
BJP sources admitted it had been a hurriedly organised programme, after Rahul had announced his Yatra.Advertisement
A party source said that given Sarma‚Äôs long innings in the Congress before he joined the BJP, the CM was particularly sensitive about the message that went out about the Yatra from Assam.
As a BJP leader said, ‚ÄúHad Rahul made Assam the launching pad of the second leg of his Yatra, Sarma would have faced a lot of flak in the party. It would have been worse for him because of his past in the Congress.‚Äù",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-leaders-rahul-yatra-assam-ne-9136211/
"How Places of Worship Act was debated in Parliament:  ‚ÄòForeclosing future rows‚Äô, ‚Äòwhy Ayodhya only exception‚Äô","How the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi mosque title suit is settled may come down to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act essentially declare that the religious character of a place of worship, barring the then-contested Rajanmabhoomi in Ayodhya, will continue to be the same as on August 15, 1947, and that no person shall convert any place of worship of any religious denomination into one of a different denomination or section.
The Supreme Court is in the process of hearing whether the 1991 Act bars even the filing of such a plea regarding any other place of worship. So far, only oral observations have been submitted, with the Court yet to conclusively rule on the issue.
The 1991 Act had been brought in by the then Congress government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao at a time when the Ram temple movement was at its peak. The Babri Masjid was still standing, but L K Advani‚Äôs rath yatra, his arrest in Bihar, and the firing on kar sevaks in Uttar Pradesh had raised communal tensions. The Congress argued that the Bill would help prevent future communal clashes.
The Bill was introduced in the 1991 Monsoon Session, and saw at least eight hours of debate, marred by frequent interruptions and expunged remarks, with intense opposition from the BJP‚Äôs side. Over the course of the debate, spread out over three days, both sides claimed that their position would ensure communal harmony.

Ultimately, the Bill was passed without any major amendments and retained the exclusion of Ayodhya and Jammu and Kashmir from its purview. A year later, in December 1992, the Babri Masjid was destroyed by activists of the VHP and other Hindu groups, leading to communal violence across the country. Narasimha Rao was heavily criticised for his government‚Äôs handling of the situation, including permitting the BJP-led UP government, which refused to use central paramilitary forces, to oversee security measures.
In 2022, Krishna Pal Singh Yadav, the BJP MP from Guna, introduced a private member‚Äôs Bill for repeal of the Act. However, it has not yet come up for discussion.
A look back at the debate in Parliament over the 1991 Act:
Government standAdvertisement
The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by then Home Minister S B Chavan with the objective of ‚Äúprohibiting conversion of places of worship and to provide for the maintenance of their religious character as it existed on August 15, 1947‚Äù.
The Congress had promised to introduce the Bill in its 1991 election manifesto and it was also mentioned in the President‚Äôs address to Parliament earlier that year.
‚ÄúIt is considered necessary to adopt these measures in view of the controversies arising from time to time with regard to conversion of places of worship, which tend to vitiate the communal atmosphere,‚Äù Chavan said after introducing the Bill. ‚ÄúI am sure that enactment of this Bill will go a long way in helping restore communal amity and goodwill.‚ÄùAdvertisement

Near the end of the debate on the Bill, Chavan said, ‚ÄúIn recent years, we have noticed with anxiety an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests. One of the methods‚Ä¶ is taking resort to forcible conversion of places of worship to create new disputes and to rake up old controversies‚Ä¶ We consider it necessary to take steps to put an immediate end to such unfortunate conflicts and foreclose any new controversies. This Bill‚Ä¶ seeks to achieve this objective.‚Äù
BJP stand
The BJP said the Bill fell ‚Äúoutside the legislative competence‚Äù of the Lok Sabha. Jaswant Singh, then the BJP MP from Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, who would later become a Union minister under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government that followed, led the debate for the party. Singh argued that the Bill was ‚Äúviolative of the Constitution‚Äù since it legislated on an issue reserved for state governments.
The state list in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution includes ‚Äúpilgrimages, other than pilgrimages to places outside India‚Äù. Singh‚Äôs contention was that ‚Äúif places of worship are not places of pilgrimage, then what else are they‚Äù.
Singh also said that since many places of worship were linked to burial and cremation sites, another subject under the state list, the Bill encroached on states‚Äô rights.
Jaswant Singh went on to call the Bill violative of the fundamental right to religion, citing sections of the Constitution that say every religious denomination or section has the right ‚Äúto own and acquire movable and immovable property‚Äù and ‚Äúto administer such property in accordance with law‚Äù.Advertisement
‚ÄúI think we are somewhere impinging on this fundamental right. It is of course a Constitutional question and you will ask me to explain whether a Constitutional question can be raised, but I consider it prudent to raise this now and here,‚Äù Singh said.
The BJP also opposed the exclusion of J&K from the Bill. ‚ÄúI believe that with the exclusion of Jammu and Kashmir, where it is well enough known that a great many temples have been desecrated, would it not be violative of basic and fundamental equity and the Constitution?‚Äù Singh said.Advertisement
Many of Singh‚Äôs BJP colleagues were more hostile in their criticism of the Bill. BJP MP Ram Naik, from Bombay North, who went on to become a Union minister under Vajpayee, called it the ‚Äúblackest Bill in Indian Parliament‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis Bill proposes to legalise all encroachments upon Hindu temples made during Mughal and British rule,‚Äù he said.
Advani, who led the rath yatra, was at the time the Leader of the Opposition, and would go on to be an accused in the Babri Masjid case (later acquitted), only briefly expressed his opposition to the Bill before staging a walk-out. ‚ÄúI believe that this Bill is thoroughly ill-conceived. The Bill is totally unwarranted‚Ä¶ We cannot associate ourselves with this Bill. We are opposing its introduction,‚Äù he said.Advertisement
Uma Bharti, a firebrand BJP MP from Khajuraho who would also be later among the acquitted accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, cited a sub-clause in the Bill that said that any existing legal disputes on the conversion of religious sites would cease after the enactment of the law, to claim that the dispute over the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi would be settled outside the courts.
‚ÄúI am very glad that though the Congress government might not agree with us on various issues, yet it appears that it‚Ä¶ has accepted our view that issues of faith cannot be decided in courts. I would be thankful to the government that Ayodhya has been excluded from the purview of this Bill. All this shows that the government does not want confrontation and we also do not want confrontation, although we are not afraid of any confrontation,‚Äù Bharti said.
Bharti suggested that the Bill would encourage communal violence. ‚ÄúI heard in childhood that pigeons fear the presence of cats. Pigeons are so innocent that they believe the mere closing of eyes will prove to be an effective shield against cats. But this is not correct. Maintenance of the status quo as in 1947, in respect of religious places, is like closing eyes like pigeons against the advancement of cats. This maintenance of the status quo of 1947 will mean preservation of tension for the coming generations,‚Äù she said.
Bharti also spoke about a visit to the disputed Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, where she claimed to have seen ‚Äúremnants of the temple‚Äù. ‚ÄúSome sort of current of anger ran through my body. I felt disgraced at the fate of my ancestors‚Ä¶ Was not the intention of Aurangzeb behind leaving remnants of a temple at the site of the mosque to keep reminding Hindus of their historical fate and to remind coming generations of Muslims of their past glory and power?‚Ä¶ l would like to know from the movers of the Bill, why they want to preserve and protect the wrong done by Aurangzeb‚Ä¶ Why are they keeping the bone of contention alive?‚Äù she said, adding that the Bill was a form of ‚Äúappeasement‚Äù.
Other BJP MPs, including Rajasthan legislator Guman Mal Lodha, said the Bill was unnecessary as other laws already offered the same protections. ‚ÄúThere is already a law regarding the trespassing of property‚Ä¶ This law is an illusory law and it is full of confusion. It is not going to benefit either Hindu or Muslim,‚Äù he said.
Congress and other parties
P M Sayeed, the Congress‚Äôs then Lakshadweep MP, who supported the Bill, asked why the Ayodhya site had been left out of its purview. ‚ÄúI request the Home Minister to clarify why it is kept out of the Bill. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has circulated some series of letters in which they have (raised) not only Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi but also Varanasi, Mathura and Taj Mahal. They want to demolish all these,‚Äù he said.
The CPI(M)‚Äôs Somnath Chatterjee, the then MP from Bengal‚Äôs Bolpur, who would later become the Lok Sabha Speaker under the first UPA government, said his party would have preferred the inclusion of the Ayodhya dispute, but they accepted the Bill given that Ayodhya had become a ‚Äúgreat emotional issue‚Äù that should be solved by ‚Äúmutual discussion‚Äù.
He also questioned the BJP resorting to the pilgrimage argument. ‚ÄúAfter a good deal of searching and burning the midnight oil, they (the BJP) have come to‚Ä¶ pilgrimages‚Ä¶ So far as pilgrimage is concerned‚Ä¶ this Bill does not purport to restrict anybody going to a place of worship,‚Äù said Chatterjee, who also cited the dictionary definition of ‚Äòpilgrimage‚Äô in his remarks.
Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, an MP and then national president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), was stronger in his criticism on this point. ‚ÄúAs far as Section 5 of the Bill is concerned, it should be deleted because this keeps Babri Masjid out of the purview of the Bill. I cannot understand why this exception,‚Äù Sait said.
Hyderabad‚Äôs then AIMIM MP Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi and then Union minister of Parliamentary Affairs and J&K Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, however, argued that the Bill would help prevent further politicisation of religious issues.
‚ÄúI would like to ask those who are opposing this Bill as to why this Babri Masjid issue was not raised just after 1947 and why they did not raise the issue in 1977 during the Janata regime when‚Ä¶ Vajpayee and Advani (were ministers). Why do they raise this issue now? So one can easily understand that this is not simply an issue for them, rather they want to exploit it for acquiring power,‚Äù Owaisi said.
‚ÄúThe time has come when through this Bill we can impose some checks on some political parties which adopt religion as a means to win elections‚Ä¶ In my opinion, there is no law more effective than this law to maintain the unity and integrity of the country,‚Äù Azad said.
Digvijaya Singh, who was the Congress‚Äôs Rajgarh MP at the time, would later become the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and remains one of the party‚Äôs more strident voices against Hindutva, was among those against the exclusion of J&K from the Bill.
‚ÄúI would urge the Home minister to reconsider this decision and not to allow our friends on this side to create a kind of propaganda against this Bill. They would be exploiting this Bill for their own political ends, which is quite obvious, seeing their performance in this House. That is why, I urge the Home minister to‚Ä¶ extend it to the state of J&K,‚Äù he said.
The late Ram Vilas Paswan, who was the Janata Dal MP from Bihar‚Äôs Rosera at the time, said the Bill was ‚Äúbetter late than never‚Äù. ‚ÄúHad the Congress party brought such a legislation earlier, I am certain that‚Ä¶ the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute would not have arisen‚Ä¶ We have far more important problems before us‚Ä¶ This country cannot afford to squabble over trifling issues like mandir or masjid,‚Äù he said. Paswan‚Äôs party (including both its factions) is now a partner of the BJP.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/1991-places-of-worship-act-gyanvapi-mosque-case-9138210/
"Nitish Kumar hits back, slams Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs ‚Äòfaltu baat‚Äô on caste survey, Tejashwi for jobs claim","A DAY AFTER Congress leader Rahul Gandhi broke his silence over the exit of Nitish Kumar from the INDIA bloc and attributed it to his ‚Äúreluctance‚Äù to conduct a caste survey, the Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) supremo joined words with him.
In his first such remarks attacking his former partners at length, Nitish said it was ‚Äúfaltu baat (useless talk)‚Äù on Rahul‚Äôs part to try and take credit for the caste survey done by the Mahagathbandhan government led by him. He also questioned RJD leader and his former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav saying that it was his party‚Äôs ministers who had led the job push under the Mahagathbandhan government.

In another swipe at the INDIA alliance, Nitish said it ‚Äúhad not achieved anything‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have nothing to do with it now. In fact, I was against calling it INDIA. But they decided to go with this name. I had taken initiative to form it, but it did not do a single thing. Hence, I have walked out of it and joined the NDA. Ab yehi rahenge (I will stick to the NDA now).‚Äù
The acronym, standing for ‚ÄòIndian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance‚Äô, is believed to have been arrived at by the Congress and Trinamool Congress jointly at INDIA‚Äôs Bengaluru meeting, with other partners taken by surprise.
On Rahul‚Äôs remarks at the Purnea rally, which was part of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, that they had made Nitish agree to do the caste survey, the CM said: ‚ÄúNonsense. Everyone knows I got the resolution passed in 2019 and 2020 for conducting a caste survey in Bihar. When the Central government did not conduct it for some reasons, we decided to go ahead and hold it in Bihar. We held meetings with nine parties.‚Äù
Nitish, in fact, was talking of a caste census since before he switched over from the NDA to join hands with the Mahagathbandhan in August 2022.
Asked about the allegation of the Opposition that the Central government was on a witch-hunt against its leaders, through probes by different agencies, Nitish said: ‚ÄúThese agencies are investigating old cases. It is part of the process of investigation.‚ÄùAdvertisement

He also claimed that it was only after he took over as CM in 2006, for the first time, that the state had embarked on the path of growth and development.
On Tejashwi comparing the achievements of the last 17 months of the Mahagathbandhan government to the 17 years Nitish has been CM, he said: ‚ÄúWhen I took over the reins of Bihar, he (Tejashwi) was a child. Everyone knows all the major development initiatives have been taken after 2006. Where were government jobs before 2006? We started recruiting teachers and giving jobs in other departments later.‚Äù",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/nitish-rahul-tejashwi-rjd-jdu-india-9137465/
"With BJP‚Äôs three new faces, a new chapter for social justice in India","The BJP‚Äôs choice of chief ministers in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh marks the dawn of a new era in the politics of social justice in the country. The silent and remarkable commitment of the party leadership to not only cultivating leaders from marginalised sections but also consciously placing them in consequential positions of leadership is significant. Mohan Yadav, a leader from the OBC communities, has been named chief minister in Madhya Pradesh, Dalit leader Jagdish Devda is the Deputy CM; in Chhattisgarh, tribal leader Vishnu Deo Sai is the new CM and the OBC leader Arun Sao is Deputy CM; Prem Chand Bairwa, another Dalit leader in Rajasthan, is the Deputy CM.
These appointments are a reflection of the BJP‚Äôs organisational commitment to the idea of real, not perceived, social justice.
Beyond the social diversity context, these leaders have much to offer. Factors like smooth generational shift and a focus on qualification and merit should also be considered. The majority of them have spent their life in public service as representatives and carry academic credentials. CM Mohan Yadav has a PhD, for example. In a stern message to the cadre-based organisation, the premium on experience and ideological commitment has been reinforced.
In his book, The New BJP: Modi and the Making of the World‚Äôs Largest Political Party, Nalin Mehta makes a compelling observation, ‚ÄúIn June 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out in a video address to his party workers that the BJP was represented by 113 OBC, 43 ST and 53 SC MPs in the Lok Sabha. In other words, a full 37.2 per cent of the BJP Lok Sabha MPS were OBC, 14.1 per cent ST and 17.4 per cent SC. This means that a whopping 68.9 per cent (209) of all its 303 Lok Sabha MPs elected in 2019 were non-upper caste and were from castes that were traditionally considered lower down in the caste hierarchy. This is strikingly on par with the widely accepted national share of the population of these castes: 69.2 per cent.‚Äù It is established that Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs oft-repeated and unoriginal rhetoric on representation based on the share of the population was nothing but hollow demagoguery.
Congress‚Äôs hypocrisy on caste and social justice is no longer a matter of surprise. Only recently during the oath-taking ceremony of the Chief Minister of Telangana, Revanth Reddy consciously did not touch the feet of Mallikarjun Kharge, who comes from the Dalit community, right after he touched Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs feet. For a community that has faced years of institutional ostracisation, these things matter and must not be ignored. The Dalit imagination asks for respect, recognition and representation. The recent struggle between Mallikarjun Kharge and D K Sivakumar on the release of the caste census report in Karnataka is another brick in the wall of the ambivalence of the Congress party on the caste census. It is imperative to do a historical analysis of Congress in terms of the representation of Dalits. In her book, How Prime Ministers Decide, Neerja Chowdhury observes the reflection of one of the tallest Dalit leaders after Ambedkar, Jagjivan Ram, ‚ÄúA chamar can never be the Prime Minister of this country‚Äù. Further, it reads, ‚ÄúFor Indira Gandhi, it came as a windfall. ‚ÄòKissi bhi keemat par Jagjivan Ram Pradhan Mantri nahi banana chahiye,‚Äô she would tell her confidantes. ‚ÄòHatenge nahi zindagi bhar.‚Äô‚Äù It is noteworthy but not pertinent to mention the machinations that were orchestrated against him and his son in the subsequent years.
Congress as an organisation is structurally, characteristically, a feudal party that has never encouraged real inclusive leadership. The Madhya Pradesh elections brought forth a deep faultline ‚Äî Akhilesh Yadav, a prominent OBC leader, was called names and insulted by the senior leadership of the Congress party.
The recent political appointments will open a new chapter in the life of Indian democracy. There is a renewed sense of hope and aspiration within marginalised sections after decades of mere symbolism. From the first tribal woman at the highest constitutional office to the first elected tribal CM in Chhattisgarh, an extraordinary faith in the Dalit leadership is a sign of times to come. This will challenge the conventional wisdom of caste and communities rallying behind family-based political enterprises which are distinctly unwilling to explore power-sharing beyond one family.

"Decode Politics: In Telangana, the curious case of missing BRS government files","Just as the Revanth Reddy-led Congress administration seems to be settling down in Telangana, a curious case of damaged and missing government files has come up in the state. The blame has fallen on the aides of Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader and former Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav who is one of the CM‚Äôs oldest political rivals.
What is the case?
Earlier this week, barely days after the Congress government took charge in the state, several key files in the animal husbandry department were found either missing or damaged.
Yadav‚Äôs Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Kalyan Kumar and four others were booked following a complaint by a security guard at the department. The watchman, in his complaint, told the police that he saw Kumar, computer operators Mohan and Elija, and attendants Venkatesh and Prashanth in the office at the time of the incident. The watchman discovered the damaged files during a routine check.

Apart from the missing files, some security cameras in the department were also found to be broken, raising suspicions about the incident. Kumar has alleged he is being implicated in the case because of political reasons and has approached the Telangana High Court seeking anticipatory bail.
What files were these?
Sources said the destroyed and ‚Äúsome stolen‚Äù files pertained to the procurement of fodder for cattle. A Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, ‚ÄúImagine the scale of corruption that they were in such a hurry to destroy files which would expose their malpractices.‚Äù
BRS insiders, however, said the minister had nothing to do with the incident. ‚ÄúIf the minister had to hide something, he could have taken the files while vacating the office. He has nothing to do with it (the incident),‚Äù said a leader.
An old rivalry 
Both Yadav and Revanth were colleagues in the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Though they never had a public fallout, Yadav, who is senior to the CM, was known to be uncomfortable with Revanth‚Äôs meteoric rise in the party.Advertisement

Following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, Yadav was among the TDP leaders who joined the BRS (then Telangana Rashtra Samithi, or TRS). He gradually grew close to K Chandrashekar Rao, or KCR, and is known to be his close aide. Revanth, meanwhile, quit the TDP in 2017 and joined the Congress, where yet again he quickly rose up the ranks and became the state Congress chief.
Both leaders have been known to share an uneasy equation since their TDP days. During the recent Assembly election campaign, they engaged in a war of words, with Yadav telling Revanth to control his tongue. The Congress leader also faced backlash from the Golla-Kuruma communities for his comments against Yadav.
Political ramifications
The case of the missing files can potentially be the Pandora‚Äôs Box for the BRS. While the probe in the case is in its initial stages, any alleged irregularities will provide the Congress and the BJP with an I-told-you-so moment ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. For the BRS, which has been accused of corruption during its nine-year rule, it would further dent the party‚Äôs prospects in the parliamentary polls.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/decode-politics-telangana-curious-case-missing-brs-government-files-9068154/
"Statues of PM, Yogi ‚Äòguard‚Äô a rooftop temple against demolition in Bharuch","A scrap merchant‚Äôs solution to a looming demolition threat against his alleged unauthorised construction has caught the officials of the Bharuch-Ankleshwar Urban Development Authority (BAUDA) off guard. Mohanlal Gupta, who allegedly constructed an additional floor in a building he had bought last year, has now built a ‚Äútemple‚Äù with the idols of Lord Ram, Sita and Laxman. What more, statues resembling Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stand ‚Äòguard‚Äô outside the rooftop shrine.
Gupta, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, also went a step ahead and inaugurated the temple atop the purported illegal scrap godown on January 22 to coincide with the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya by PM Modi.
The scrap merchant‚Äôs unprecedented move came soon after BAUDA officials inspected the building following a complaint by Mansukh Rakhasiya, resident of Jantanagar society in Gadkhol village of Ankleshwar. After fresh complaints about the rooftop temple, BAUDA officials Tuesday visited the spot and found that Gupta had constructed an additional floor without prior permission.
BAUDA has now given him seven days to submit necessary documents. However, according to Gupta, Jitendra Oza, from whom he had bought the property last year, had already taken permission for the construction from Gadkhol Gram Panchayat in 2012.
Gupta alleged that envious people have complained against the structure. ‚ÄúI have made changes to the property by demolishing some parts. There are some people who are jealous of me and are threatening to get the structure demolished. They have also demanded money from me. They reside in a residential society far from our Riddhi Siddhi society,‚Äù he said.

According to Rakhasiya‚Äôs first complaint, lodged on July 11, 2023, ‚Äúno prior permission was taken‚Äù for alleged illegal constructions, including that of Gupta‚Äôs, in three residential societies of the village.
Apart from Gupta‚Äôs two-storey building in the Riddhi Siddhi residential society, one built by Ramjikumar Maurya in Arunodaynagar Society and another by Ravi Vishwakarma at Niravkunj Society were the other two named by the complainant.Advertisement
After the complaint failed to elicit action, he filed another application before Bharuch District Collector Tushar Sumera on December 1. Following this, BAUDA officials visited the site for an inspection on December 21.
On January 1 this year, Rakhasiya followed it up with a letter to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel detailing about the three constructions. This time, he also demanded that strict action be taken against BAUDA officials for their inaction.
On Tuesday, the BAUDA team visited the site again after Rakhasiya contacted them again with photos and videos from the inaugural event, invitations for which were extended to the village sarpanch and residents.Advertisement
Gadkhol village Sarpanch Manjulaben Patel said she did not attend the inauguration, but has learnt that a ‚Äúlarge number of people attended the event‚Äù. Photos and videos of the event have since gone viral on social media.
BAUDA incharge town planner Nitin Patel told The Indian Express that they have given seven days to Gupta to submit necessary documents of the plot and other details. ‚ÄúPrimarily, it has been found that the entire building was not renovated (as was claimed), but newly constructed. Gupta stays in a house just opposite to the new building at Riddhi Siddhi society. It is a residential society and he uses this building for commercial purposes. He had also made two shutters‚Ä¶ After seven days, on the basis of documents submitted by Gupta, further actions will be taken,‚Äù he said.
Further, he explained that Gupta had done sale deed documents in the name of his wife Kiran on January 21, 2023, after purchasing the structure from Oza. ‚ÄúThe sale deed document shows only the ground floor, but our team found a newly constructed building of ground plus one floor and terrace with a temple on the roof on Tuesday,‚Äù he said. He added that Gupta uses a common open plot, behind the scrap godown, for keeping waste gunny bags. ‚ÄúHowever, no construction activity has been done on it,‚Äù Patel added.
Rakhasiya, however, alleged that authorities have taken no action against illegal constructions in the village. ‚ÄúWe have also written to Bharuch Collector Tushar Sumera and Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and demanded that actions should be taken,‚Äù he told The Indian Express, adding that the rooftop temple with the statues was Gupta‚Äôs ‚Äúsmart‚Äù move to save his property from getting demolished.
Meanwhile, Gupta alleged that the complainant has been threatening him regularly. ‚ÄúI have built the temple on the rooftop and installed statues of PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogiji. I believe Mansukh and others did not like it. They are threatening me regularly. I request the district authorities to protect me from such people,‚Äù he said.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/statues-of-pm-yogi-guard-a-rooftop-temple-against-demolition-in-bharuch-9135684/
"IRS officer, who demanded dismissal of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suspended","Two days before he was set to retire, Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer B Balamurugan from Tamil Nadu, who had demanded the dismissal of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over an ED case, was suspended by the Union Ministry of Finance on Monday.
As per reports, Balamurugan was scheduled to retire on Wednesday.
Balamurugan, who served as Deputy Commissioner of GST and CEx, Chennai (North), wrote to President Droupadi Murmu earlier in January seeking the dismissal of Union Minister Sitharaman for ‚Äòconverting the ED into an extended arm of BJP‚Äô. The officer had written to President Murmu over the July 2023 Enforcement Directorate summons to two Dalit farmers in Tamil Nadu‚Äôs Salem district in a case of alleged money laundering.
Balamurugan‚Äôs wife, Dalit G Pravina, was the lawyer of the farmers in the ED case, which has been closed now.
The suspension order issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and dated January 29, which indianexpress.com has seen, did not cite any other reason for suspending Balamurugan.
The suspension order also said that disciplinary proceedings are being contemplated against Balamurugan. It added that the suspended official should not leave the headquarters without obtaining prior permission from the competent authority.
While speaking to local media on Tuesday, Balamurugan said he was suspended because he wrote to President Murmu demanding the removal of Nirmala Sitharaman.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/irs-officer-nirmala-sitharaman-suspended-9136269/
Masih as ‚ÄòBJP messiah‚Äô: Meet presiding officer at centre of Chandigarh mayoral tussle,"Presiding officer Anil Masih was at the centre of the drama that unfolded in the Chandigarh mayoral elections on Tuesday. The BJP‚Äôs Manoj Sonkar won the close election after 8 votes of the parties on the other side were declared invalid by Masih, prompting the AAP and the Congress, who were contesting together as INDIA bloc partners, to accuse him of tampering with the result.
Earlier on January 18, when the elections were originally slated, Masih had suddenly fallen ill, leading to the polls being postponed to January 30. The municipal secretary, Gurinder Sodhi, too had taken leave two days before the January 18 polls allegedly due to back pain.

The Congress and AAP have accused Masih of scribbling on the ballot papers to render them invalid.
Masih joined the BJP in 2018 and is an active member of the party‚Äôs minority wing. He is currently among the nine nominated councillors (they do not have voting rights) in the general house of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.

He was nominated in 2022 apparently as a face to represent the issues of minorities in the House.
Sources within the BJP said that Masih, who was close to former BJP president Arun Sood, was one of the contenders for the BJP ticket during the Chandigarh civic polls in December 2021 from Ward No. 13.
However, almost after a year, Masih was selected as the nominated councillor in 2022.Advertisement

As recently as January 10, Masih was seen sharing the stage as AAP councillor Lakhbir Singh joined the BJP. This too had provoked reactions from the Opposition.

"Decode politics: Tribals key, how Naveen govt doing damage control over law, unveiling promises in Odisha","Three months after it decided to amend a 67-year-old regulation to allow the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals in scheduled areas, the Odisha government on Monday decided to withdraw the decision that had run into controversy.
The reversal by the government seemed to have been driven by apprehensions of a tribal backlash ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state.
What is the law in question? 
The Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (By Scheduled Tribes) Regulation, 1956, allows the transfer of tribal land only to other members of the tribal community. ‚ÄúAny transfer of immovable property by a member of a Scheduled Tribe, except by way of mortgage executed in favour of any public financial institution for securing a loan granted by such institution for any agricultural purpose, shall be absolutely null and void‚Ä¶ unless such transfer is made in favour of another member of a Scheduled Tribe,‚Äù the law, last amended in 2002, states.
The law also prohibits the sale of land held by tribals if it means the remaining landholding held by them falls to less than 2 acres in case of irrigated land and 5 acres in case of non-irrigated land.

What did the now-withdrawn amendment propose?
The amendment to Regulation 2 of the Act allowed the sale of lands held by tribals to non-tribals and also allowed them to mortgage lands with public financial institutions for non-agricultural purposes.
What forced the government‚Äôs hand?
Protests broke out following the announcement, leading to the state government announcing on November 17 last year that it had decided to withhold the proposal. The announcement was made by Odisha Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Sudam Marndi, who had hailed the decision earlier, without elaborating.Advertisement
Opposition parties, which led the protests, called the amendment ‚Äúa conspiracy against the tribals‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe feel the amendment was made to legalise benami property transactions by land mafia in tribal areas,‚Äù BJP MLA Nityananda Gond said.

A senior official, requesting anonymity, admitted the government feared that the tribals could take the wrong message from the amnendment. ‚ÄúThe Opposition tried to provoke tribals with ill-intention. The government had taken the decision for the benefit of tribals following recommendations of the Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC). It later realised that the decision may hamper its tribal support base,‚Äù it said.
How important are tribals in Odisha politics?
Tribals comprise 22.85% of the state‚Äôs population. Thirty-three of the 147 Assembly constituencies and 5 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats are reserved for them. In 2019, the BJD and BJP had each won 2 of the reserved Lok Sabha tribal seats, while 1 was bagged by the Congress.Advertisement
In the simultaneous Assembly polls, the BJD and BJP bagged 18 and 11 tribal seats respectively while Congress got only 2. One each had gone to the CPI(M) and an Independent.
The state is home to 62 tribes, including 13 particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). There are 21 tribal languages and 74 identified dialects.
How has the Naveen Patnaik government been trying to ensure tribal support?
Apart from withdrawing the amendment, the Odisha Cabinet recently approved a Rs 100 crore scheme ‚Äî ‚ÄòLaghu Bana Jatya Drabya Kraya‚Äô or ‚ÄòLABHA‚Äô ‚Äî under which the state government will procure minor forest produce at Minimum Support Price (MSP) from 14 tribal-dominated districts.
Chief Secretary P K Jena said the scheme would be fully sponsored by the state. ‚ÄúThe Tribal Development Cooperative Corporation of Odisha Ltd, a state-owned agency, will procure the produce on behalf of the state government through Mission Shakti. It will benefit more than 30,000 primary collectors, 1,000 self-help groups in 119 blocks of 14 districts,‚Äù he said.Advertisement
Sources claimed the government came up with LABHA as a similar Central government scheme had seen no release of funds over the past 10 years beyond the initial revolving funds.
The Cabinet has also approved the constitution of a Commission, with a rank of Cabinet minister, to ‚Äúpreserve and protect‚Äù tribal languages and dialects. ‚ÄúThe commission will also help tribal children get education in their mother tongue apart from other languages at school-level. It will enable the government to set up a database to document and preserve endangered tribal languages and promote the use of indigenous languages in official communication to protect the linguistic diversity,‚Äù state SC/ST Development Secretary Roopa Roshan Sahoo said.Advertisement
In May last year, the government had set up special development councils (SDCs) in 14 tribal-dominated districts taking the number of districts having the body to 23. The SDCs, initially formed in September 2017 districts in nine districts with a tribal population of more than 50%, work to conserve tribal culture, traditions and indigenous lifestyles. With an expenditure of Rs 223 crore on SDCs, the government claims that the move has benefited 80 lakh tribals.
Besides, the Odisha Cabinet has given a nod to the government sending another proposal to the Centre urging it to include 169 communities in the ST list of Odisha.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/decode-politics-tribals-naveen-patnaik-odisha-9136590/
Today in Politics: All eyes on Modi govt 2.0‚Äôs last Budget; suspense over Jharkhand Governor‚Äôs move on new CM,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present on Thursday the Narendra Modi government 2.0‚Äôs last Budget before the Lok Sabha elections, which are round the corner.
This will be Sitharaman‚Äôs sixth consecutive Budget, although this time it will be an interim Budget also referred to as a vote on account as it seeks Parliament‚Äôs nod for a grant in advance to meet the central government‚Äôs essential expenditure for the first four months of the new fiscal year beginning April. A new government elected after the Lok Sabha polls will present the full Budget in July.
Sitharaman‚Äôs Budget speech is likely to showcase the achievements of the Modi government not just over the past year but also over the past decade. 
The Budget is likely to contain a mix of measures for the economy and electorally significant sections like farmers and women.
While the BJP does not face any pressure for populist measures, given its dominance in the heartland as evidenced by its resounding victory in recent Assembly elections in three states, Sitharaman is expected to stick to being fiscally prudent while sprinkling sops on sectors like agriculture and engines of the economy that would create jobs and boost consumption. The Budget is expected to focus on infrastructure.
While going by the precedence no major policy announcements are made in a vote on accounts, it has not stopped the incumbent government from making big announcements, like the cash dole for farmers announced in the 2019 interim Budget. The Modi government had then introduced the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to provide financial support of Rs 6,000 a year for farmers with less than two hectares of land and also proposed a mega pension scheme for those in the unorganised sector. 
The Budget would, however, provide an occasion to assess the fiscal health of the economy. It would provide a platform for the government to give a clear roadmap for achieving the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) targets.Advertisement
The budgeted fiscal deficit of 5.9% of the GDP for the current fiscal is likely to be achieved, but it is nearly twice the FRBM fiscal deficit to the GDP target of 3% for the central government. Correspondingly, the debt-GDP ratio at 54% is also well above the target of 40%.
The Budget Session of Parliament got underway Wednesday with President Droupadi Murmu addressing a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. President Murmu highlighted key achievements of the Modi government during the last 10 years and outlined the major policy priorities of the government in her last address before the nation heads into the general elections.
JMM leader Champai Soren‚Äôs govt-formation claim 
Jharkhand has plunged into a political crisis</strong> as the state‚Äôs new Chief Minister was not sworn in hours after the incumbent CM and JMM leader Hemant Soren resigned before being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday night.Advertisement
Accompanied by JMM leader and Transport Minister Champai Soren and several leaders of the JMM-led ruling coalition, Hemant Soren, tendered his resignation to Governor CP Radhakrishnan at the Raj Bhavan in Ranchi, which was accepted by the Governor. At the same time, 
Champai Soren, who was elected as the new leader of the JMM Legislature Party as well as the alliance, staked claim to form the new government with the support of the 47 MLAs in the 81-member House.  
‚ÄúWe have staked a claim to form the new government with the support of 47 MLAs,‚Äù Champai Soren told reporters Wednesday night.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Alamgir Alam, who also accompanied the ruling alliance‚Äôs delegation to the Raj Bhavan, said, ‚ÄúWe have handed over a support letter from 43 MLAs to the Governor who has assured to call us‚Äù.
The Governor told the incumbent alliance that he will revert on their proposal after considering the legalities. However, as Abhishek Angad reports, the Governor‚Äôs stance not to move quickly to fill the constitutional vacuum in the state triggered concerns in the JMM-led coalition of the JMM, Congress and RJD, whose tally of MLAs are 29, 17, and 1, respectively. In the Opposition camp, the BJP has 26 MLAs and the AJSU three. The CPI(M-L) and NCP (AP) have one MLA each while there are two Independents.Advertisement
Earlier, after more than seven hours of questioning by the ED in an alleged land scam case, Hemant resigned as the CM. He was subsequently arrested by the central agency.
Late Wednesday night, Hemant also filed a writ petition in the Jharkhand High Court against his arrest, which will hear the matter Thursday morning. The ED would also produce Hemant before a special PMLA court in Ranchi and is expected to seek his remand for custodial interrogation.Advertisement
Speculation about Hemant‚Äôs arrest was rife since around 5.30 pm Wednesday, when two mini-buses were seen going to his residence. Half an hour later, Chief Secretary L Khyangate and DGP Ajay Kumar Singh also arrived at his house.
The development capped days of political drama involving Hemant and the ED ‚Äî from the ED searching his Delhi residence Monday to the BJP claiming his ‚Äúdisappearance for 40 hours‚Äù to the JMM hitting back at the BJP dispensation and the central agencies.
Rahul Yatra in BengalAdvertisement
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will continue to make its way through West Bengal Thursday.
The first phase of the Yatra in Bengal concluded on Monday, as it stepped into Bihar from Islampur. It re-entered Bengal through Malda district on Wednesday. On Thursday, it will pass through Murshidabad, the home turf of state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is known as a staunch opponent of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC).

"An arrest long in the making, Hemant Soren under central agencies‚Äô scanner since 2020","Bringing an end to a long-drawn-out drama, senior JMM leader Hemant Soren was arrested on Wednesday night, soon after he had stepped down as Chief Minister. Before he resigned, he had spent the day being questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case.
Soren‚Äôs arrest came after he had skipped eight of 10 ED summons, the last being on Monday, when he allegedly ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù before officials reached his Delhi residence for questioning in the ED investigation into a ‚Äúhuge racket of illegal change of ownership of land by the mafia‚Äù in Jharkhand.
While dogged by investigations by Central agencies in several cases, Soren has insisted these are part of a political conspiracy to destabilise his Jharkhand government. For the JMM, the script is painfully familiar as Soren‚Äôs father, JMM founder-patriarch and three-time CM Shibu Soren‚Äôs political career remains tainted with a similar corruption allegation.
Also Read | Decode Politics: ED at his heels, what are the options before Hemant Soren
A trained engineer, Soren had followed his family into politics and fought his first election in 2005 from the Dumka Assembly seat, but lost. Four years later, he found himself among the senior JMM leadership following the sudden death of his elder brother Durga, who was considered the natural inheritor of Shibu‚Äôs political legacy.
Between 2009 and 2010, Soren had a brief stint as Rajya Sabha MP. He also served as the deputy chief minister when Arjun Munda headed a coalition of the BJP-JMM-JD(U)-AJSU later that year.
In 2013, Soren became the state‚Äôs youngest CM, but his tenure was short-lived. In the 2014 Assembly polls, the JMM lost out to the BJP, leaving Soren as the Leader of the Opposition. The JMM also received a drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
Soren finally made his comeback in the end-2019 Assembly polls, leading an Opposition coalition to a win against the BJP, and himself winning from two seats, Dumka and Barhait. The JMM-Congress-RJD combine won 47 seats and Soren became the CM for the second time.Advertisement

However, almost from the start, Soren has been battling an image problem amid growing perception of rising corruption during his tenure as CM. In September 2020, the Lokpal of India directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into a complaint of disproportionate assets against Shibu Soren and his family members.
In 2021, former BJP CM Raghubar Das released documents showing Soren had acquired a mining lease in his name while holding the mining and environment portfolio. The Jharkhand High Court issued a notice to Soren, calling it a ‚Äúserious matter‚Äù, and the BJP submitted a memorandum to then Governor Ramesh Bais, seeking the CM‚Äôs disqualification.
The Election Commission (EC) later wrote to the Chief Secretary, seeking documents on the lease so that it could formulate an opinion under Article 192 of the Constitution, which deals with the disqualification of legislators.Advertisement

It is widely believed that the EC recommended Soren‚Äôs disqualification. The EC had sent its opinion in a closed envelope in August 2022, however, it was never made public. Insiders had argued that the issue was at best immoral, not illegal.
Later, the Supreme Court struck down the PIL pertaining to Soren owning the mining lease filed in Jharkhand High Court stating that when the EC was looking into it, entertaining the PIL was a waste of time.
However, despite repeated demands by the CM and his party, as well as by other parties in the state, the Governor declined to make the EC‚Äôs opinion public or to act on it.
During a hearing, Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan told the High Court that the state government admitted it had committed ‚Äúa mistake‚Äù and the lease had since been surrendered.

In September 2022, at a special session of the Assembly, Soren won a trust vote with the BJP and AJSU boycotting proceedings. Soren gave a speech accusing the BJP of trying to bring down his government, and attacked the Governor for not coming clean on the EC‚Äôs recommendation.Advertisement
Over the course of 2023, the ED continued to summon Soren though the former CM skipped each one.
In response to an ED summons in August last year, Soren wrote to the agency that it was ‚Äúdeliberate and part of the design to besmirch his reputation‚Äù. He added that Central agencies had been targeting him for over a year only because he was not aligned with the political party in power at the Centre.Advertisement
In response to a summons in December, Soren discreetly sent a letter to the ED stating that in the CBI‚Äôs preliminary inquiry ‚Äì based on the complaint with the Lokpal ‚Äì all his and his family‚Äôs assets had been disclosed. ‚ÄúIssuance of repeated summons is actually malice and part of a political conspiracy to destabilise a democratically elected government. The undersigned shall readily provide any information or documents which you may bona fide require and which are not already available with you, provided you are entitled to seek the same in accordance with law,‚Äù Soren wrote.
Last December, Jharkhand Governor C P Radhakrishnan had sparked off a fresh controversy when in response to a query from The Indian Express on the EC sealed report containing its opinion on Soren owning a mining lease, and whether or not it will be made public, Radhakrishnan said, ‚ÄúI am repeatedly telling you, those who have done something wrong, those who are found guilty, have to face the consequences.

"Day 1 in new Parliament building: Excitement, tablets and a dose of protest over a mic that fell silent","Splash of excitement, a bit of confusion, some chanting that was gently brought down and complaints over a mic that fell silent. In a nutshell, it was more than business as usual for the MPs on the first day in the new Parliament building on Tuesday.
As they walked into the new Lok Sabha, many MPs were seen checking out the seats and tech devices placed in front of them. Some were more interested in the Sengol installed in the House, and the big screens on both sides of Speaker Om Birla‚Äôs chair. Some of the MPs found other talking points: the green carpets with peacock motifs and the huge windows near the ceiling embossed with the national bird.
Before the House met officially, many of the MPs from the ruling as well as the opposition sides were seen clicking pictures, with the younger members helping the seniors in getting the right angle and light shade.
See pictures | MPs walk from old Parliament building to new: A transition in photos
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was the most sought after as his party MPs patiently waited for their turn to be clicked with him. Rahul, who largely wore a serious look, then took his seat and engaged in a conversation with party colleague Kodikkunnil Suresh, who was seen explaining something animatedly.
Sonia Gandhi, who was seated in the first row for the Central Hall function earlier in the day, was not present.
The Congress members were amused to see two of their party colleagues from the Rajya Sabha ‚Äì Rajiv Shukla and Rajni Patil ‚Äì inside the Lok Sabha chamber. Finding themselves in the wrong chamber, both exited quickly.
Among those in the visitors‚Äô gallery was actor Kangana Ranaut, who was present to witness the introduction of the women‚Äôs Bill.Advertisement
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered the Lok Sabha with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and other ministers, the BJP MPs gave him a loud welcome by thumping desks, much to the discomfort of the opposition members. Soon came chants of ‚ÄúModi, Modi‚Äù from the women seated in the visitors‚Äô gallery.
The opposition MPs sprang from their seats, asking ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat is happening‚Äù, pointing towards the gallery.
The Prime Minister was seen giving directions to his ministers to calm down the visitors. Shah called both Gajendra Shekhawat and Anurag Thakur to see to it that the visiting women sat there quietly.Advertisement
As the Prime Minister announced the women‚Äôs Bill, it brought jubilation in the treasury benches. But the House did not miss the usual slogan shouting and protests. Shah and other ministers objected to Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury‚Äôs remark that the Bill, which was passed by Rajya Sabha in 2010, still stands. As the ministers protested, backbenchers from the Congress side were heard shouting: ‚ÄúSit there and listen to him.‚Äù
Shah argued that what Chowdhury said was factually wrong as the Bill, moved to Lok Sabha for consideration and passing after being cleared by the Rajya Sabha, lapsed with the dissolution of 15th Lok Sabha. Chowdhury tried to explain, but his mic fell silent, leading to protests from his party MPs.
The Congress MPs rushed towards the centre of the House, shouting slogans such as ‚ÄúNahi chalega, tanashahi nahi chalega‚Äù. They returned to their seats only after Speaker Birla directed the staff to ensure that the mic was switched on.
But the House plunged into pandemonium again when Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal stood up to introduce the Bill. The opposition members complained that they have not been handed copies of the Bill.
‚ÄúWhere is the Bill?‚Äù shouted AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi and others joined him. Amid the chaos, the Speaker said a digital copy of the 128th Amendment Bill was uploaded on the member‚Äôs portal in advance and they can access it on the tablet placed before them.Advertisement
However, many MPs could not figure out how to open the portal. As Owaisi continued to argue that he did not get it, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey came running to his seat to show how to access the portal. Dubey then went on to help other senior leaders, including Home Minister Shah, NCP leader Supriya Sule, TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee and DMK‚Äôs T R Baalu.
While the younger MPs figured out how to operate the tablet, many senior MPs were seen fiddling with the screen. SP MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq received a walk-through from NC leader Hasnain Masoodi on how to use it.Advertisement
Once the House was adjourned, the BJP MPs praised both the magnificence of the new building. But the opposition MPs were heard complaining about the ‚Äúlack of warmth and the absence of open space‚Äù in the new building.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/day-1-new-parliament-building-protests-excitement-tablets-8947744/

"Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in West Bengal: As glass of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs car breaks, Congress cries foul","The back window of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs car broke on Wednesday as thousands of people thronged Labha Bridge in West Bengal‚Äôs Malda district to watch the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra enter the state from Bihar. While Rahul was on a bus when the incident took place, Congress leaders cried foul, calling it a security lapse.
‚ÄúAll policemen are busy with Mamata Banerjee‚Äôs rally scheduled in Malda today. Very few police officials have been deputed for this ceremony,‚Äù a senior Congress leader said, referring to the flag transfer ceremony where Bihar state president Akhilesh Singh transferred the flag to West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.
As the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra entered West Bengal again from Bihar‚Äôs Katihar, Gandhi stayed on the rooftop of a bus where the flag transfer ceremony took place. ‚ÄúDuring the flag transfer ceremony, a huge crowd surged behind Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs car. Due to pressure, the back glass of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs black Toyota broke,‚Äù a local policeman said.

‚ÄúWest Bengal administration did not cooperate with us. I don‚Äôt know whether the glass broke or was broken,‚Äù Chowdhury said after the incident.
‚ÄúRahul Gandhi‚Äôs yatra is going through all these states like Manipur, Assam, Meghalaya, Bihar, West Bengal where Congress is not in government. Somewhere Rahul‚Äôs poster was torn, somewhere he was stopped, somewhere his car glass broke. One thing is clear whatever may happen, the yatra will not stop. It will continue,‚Äù Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said.
Earlier, the West Bengal administration had denied permission to Rahul Gandhi to stay at Bhaluka Irrigation Bungalow of Malda district. The Congress subsequently changed the Yatra schedule.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/bharat-jodo-nyay-yatra-west-bengal-rahul-gandhi-glass-car-congress-9136448/
"2023‚Äôs major political events, in numbers","With 2023 coming to a close and the stage set for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, here are some of the major political developments over the past year.
New Parliament, new record for MP suspensions
On May 28, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the new Parliament building, with an expanded capacity of 888 seats (from 543) in the Lok Sabha chamber. The Rajya Sabha chamber was also expanded to 384 seats from the previous 250 capacity. The construction cost an estimated Rs 1,200 crore, though the exact figure has not been released.
However, the inauguration was boycotted by 20 Opposition parties accounting for 242 MPs in both Houses over the PM inaugurating the Parliament and ‚Äúsidelining‚Äù President Droupadi Murmu, the constitutional head of the State.
But as far as Parliament working goes, it remained a tumultuous year, beginning with the disruption-ridden Budget Session that saw the second lowest time spent functioning for this government. The following two regular Sessions of Parliament also suffered in terms of productivity, though the Monsoon and Winter Sessions saw among the most Bills passed since 2019. But each Session was marred by disruptions and many crucial, and contentious, Bills passed with little to no discussion.
Pulling a pre-Assembly poll surprise, the government held a Special Session in September, where it introduced the women‚Äôs reservation Bill, which sought to allocate 33% of the seats in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies for women. The Bill was passed by both Houses in this session.

Among the other notable legislation passed this year was the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Bill, laying down how members of the poll agency were to be appointed ‚Äì now, the Selection Committee will consist of the PM, a Union Cabinet Minister, and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha.
Among the last Bills passed this year were the three criminal law Bills, which seek to overhaul the existing Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act.Advertisement
Opinion | 141 MPs suspended: Colonial hangover in New Parliament
The Winter Session, the penultimate Session of this government before the next general elections, was the most eventful. On December 13, the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament attack, two intruders jumped into the Lok Sabha and set off canisters emitting coloured gas.
Though no MPs were harmed and the intruders were apprehended, the Opposition‚Äôs protests and demand for Union Minister Amit Shah to deliver a statement on the security breach led to 146 MPs across both Houses getting suspended ‚Äì a record high for suspensions in Parliament‚Äôs history. The Session also saw outspoken Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra getting expelled over cash-for-query allegations by the Privileges Committee.

In March, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi was disqualified from the Lok Sabha after he was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison in a defamation case for remarks made in 2019 on the Modi surname. In August though, the Supreme Court stayed his suspension and he was reinstated to the House.Advertisement
In the Monsoon Session, the Modi government faced a no-confidence motion over the PM‚Äôs silence on the ethnic clashes in Manipur. The motion was easily defeated, though Modi, in a two-hour speech, spoke briefly about Manipur. It was the second no-trust vote faced by the Modi government, after a previous one in 2018.
Nine states went to polls
Nine states held Assembly elections this year, with the government changing hands in five. While the BJP won in four states, the Congress won in two, with regional parties taking the remaining three.

In the first Assembly polls of the year, in Tripura, the BJP just about managed a majority with 32 seats. The Opposition bloc won just 14 seats, with the CPI(M) winning 11 and the Congress winning three. The TIPRA Motha, a tribal outfit that was contesting its first Assembly election, emerged as the main Opposition party.
In Meghalaya, the National People‚Äôs Party (NPP) came to power in an alliance including the BJP and United Democratic Party (UDP), which had a combined seat tally of 46 in the 60-member House. The Congress was reduced to 5 seats, from 21 in 2018.
In Nagaland, the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) won 25 seats, with North-East Democratic Alliance partner BJP winning 12 in the 60-member House. The Congress though failed to win a single seat.Advertisement
Karnataka was the Congress‚Äôs best electoral outcome this year ‚Äì it recorded a comfortable win with 135 seats, ousting the BJP from its only southern state. Its campaign was built around a series of ‚Äúguarantees‚Äù, which went on to become the model for the remaining state elections in 2023. The BJP won 66 seats and the Janata Dal (Secular) won 19; the two parties would go on to form an alliance later in the year for the Lok Sabha elections.
Five states went to polls at the end of the year in the last round of state elections before the Lok Sabha polls. The results turned out to be a disappointment for the Congress, which was hoping to consolidate its position in the states ahead of seat-sharing talks with the INDIA bloc. It lost power in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh but managed to oust the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in Telangana. For the BJP though, the year ended on a positive note with wins in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and surprises in its new CMs faces in each of these states. In Mizoram, newcomer Zoram People‚Äôs Movement (ZPM) ended 36 years of a Congress-Mizo National Front (MNF) duopoly.Advertisement
A key election-related development was the establishment of a panel headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind to explore holding simultaneous national and state elections as part of the Centre‚Äôs push for ‚Äúone nation, one election‚Äù.
It was a notable year for the Election Commission too. Of the last 11 state elections, voter turnout increased in 7 states, as reported by PTI. On an aggregate basis, the voting percentage in 11 states was 73.41%. In a first since Independence, polling stations in 126 Naxal-affected villages, where turnout was 72%, were set up in Chhattisgarh. The EC also registered an additional 22 lakh first-time voters.Advertisement
The poll agency‚Äôs seizures saw a 10-fold increase from the previous elections as the EC made a fresh push to curtail the use of money to induce the voters. Enforcement agencies made record seizures of over Rs 3,000 crore in the past 11 Assembly elections.
NDA vs INDIA: Their numbers and their conflicts
On July 18, 26 parties came together under the banner of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, with the goal of creating a nationwide Opposition bloc against the BJP for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. But the INDIA bloc, led by the Congress, has suffered from several instances of infighting and poor coordination.
With just months to go for the general elections and after the Congress‚Äôs defeats in the November-December state polls, there has been little progress on seat-sharing negotiations, with regional parties hoping the Congress will compromise. In many states, members of the bloc are in direct contest, including in states like West Bengal and Kerala, further complicating seat-sharing talks.
In terms of legislative strength, the INDIA bloc has 142 MPs in the Lok Sabha, 98 MPs in the Rajya Sabha, and 1,637 MLAs and 120 MLCs across states. This leaves it facing an uphill task against the BJP-led NDA, which has 323 LS MPs, 109 Rajya Sabha MPs, and 1,834 MLAs and 177 MLCs.

Over the course of the year, the Opposition and the Centre clashed over several issues.
One such conflict was the India versus Bharat issue. Ahead of the G20 Summit in Delhi, the government sent out invitations for a dinner hosted by the President of ‚ÄúBharat‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù, sparking speculation that the BJP may officially change the country‚Äôs name. Though Article 1 of the Constitution uses the two names interchangeably, the Opposition alleged the change was the result of the formation of the INDIA bloc.
The two blocs also clashed after remarks from Udhayanidhi Stalin, son of Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin and a state minister in the DMK government, saying ‚ÄòSanatan Dharma‚Äô should be ‚Äúeradicated‚Äù. Union Home Minister Amit Shah lashed out at the INDIA bloc for ‚Äúinsulting this country‚Äôs culture, history and Sanatan Dharma‚Äù. Udhayanidhi stood firm on his comments and INDIA bloc partner CPI was among those to side with him. But the Congress and the TMC, for instance, distanced themselves from the remarks.
One issue that may play a role in the Lok Sabha elections is the caste census. While some members of the Opposition have been calling for a nationwide caste census since the first half of the year, the debate really kicked off in October, when the Bihar government released a caste survey, putting the Backward Classes population at 63% of the total.

As Opposition parties chase the OBC vote, which has largely been cornered by the BJP, the saffron party has remained lukewarm on the issue. The BJP government at the Centre is wary that a caste census could give rise to contesting demands as well as arouse other dormant quota calls, shattering its delicate caste balancing.
The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, meanwhile has been raising the ‚ÄòJitni aabadi, utna haq (rights according to numerical strength)‚Äô slogan in an attempt to add OBC support to its minority vote consolidation. But the calls for a caste census do not appear to have resonated among voters in the recently concluded Assembly polls. Several other states have since announced plans to conduct their own caste surveys.
Manipur violence: 7 months, 175 deaths
Since May 3, Manipur has been ravaged by ethnic violence between the Kukis, a tribal group who are largely Christian, and the dominant Meiteis, who are mostly Hindu.
The conflict began over the Meiteis demand for tribal status, which the Kukis opposed over fears that it would further increase their influence in government and society, and allow them to buy land in Kuki-dominated regions and get a share of jobs reserved for Kukis.
Meiteis make up about half the state‚Äôs population and hold 40 of the 60 seats in the Assembly. CM N Biren Singh is a Meitei. While the Meiteis are concentrated in the Imphal valley, the Kukis reside in the less-developed surrounding hills.
As per the latest figures from the Manipur Police, the state has seen 175 deaths, 1,118 injuries and 32 cases of missing persons. At least 60,000 people have been left homeless. There were also 5,132 cases of arson, within which 4,786 houses had been burnt and 386 religious structures had been vandalised. During the violence, over 4,000 arms were looted from state armouries, of which 1,329 were recovered, along with 15,050 ammunition and 400 bombs.
Though the violence has eased in recent months, life has remained disrupted in Manipur. Schools and colleges have been unable to operate normally, transportation and communication networks have been hit, hurting agricultural and other economic activity.
Four years on, Supreme Court upholds Article 370 abrogation
In a year of milestones, the Supreme Court delivered a melange of seminal verdicts in 2023 including those that upheld the Centre‚Äôs decisions to scrap Article 370, which bestowed special status on Jammu and Kashmir, and the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes.
Under Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, the top court created a record by disposing of 52,191 cases between January 1 and December 15, 2023. It had disposed of nearly 40,000 cases the previous year.
To round off the year, on December 11, the Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370, more than four years after it was scrapped. But the apex court ordered the government to reinstate J&K statehood and hold Assembly elections by September 2024. Since the abrogation of Article 370, which split the state into two Union Territories, the region has been under President‚Äôs Rule and has held only two local body elections.
The region has not had an Assembly since it was dissolved in 2018, with the last state polls taking place in 2016.",,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/2023-major-political-events-in-numbers-9086049/
